{"1#": "{1: 125}", "2#": "The number of ways to assign six jobs to five employees, given that each job is assigned to only one employee and each employee is assigned at least one job, is a multivariate problem.\n\nFirst, we know that the five employees must each have at least one job. We assign one job to each employee, leaving one job left.\n\nThe remaining job can be assigned to any of the five employees. Therefore, there are 5 choices for the last job.\n\nSo the total number of arrangements is 5.\n\nThe JSON format answer would be: {\"2\": 5}.", "1#2#": "{ \"1\": 125, \"2\": 3600 }", "2#1#": "{ \"1\": 125, \"2\": 3125}"}
