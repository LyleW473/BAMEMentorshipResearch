{"1#": "(a) Since there are 5 employees and each job can be given to any of the 5 employees, the number of ways to assign three jobs to five employees is 5*5*5 = 125 ways. This is because for each of the three jobs, there are five possible employees who could be assigned the job, so you multiply the possibilities together.", "2#": "To solve this problem, we will use the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of ways to assign 6 jobs to 5 employees without any restrictions. This is simply 5^6 = 15625 ways.\n\nNow, we subtract the ways in which one or more employees get no jobs. This involves choosing a number of employees who get no jobs and assigning the jobs to the remaining employees.\n\n- Choose 1 employee to get no job: C(5,1) * 4^6 ways\n- Choose 2 employees to get no jobs: C(5,2) * 3^6 ways\n- Choose 3 employees to get no jobs: C(5,3) * 2^6 ways\n- Choose 4 employees to get no jobs: C(5,4) * 1^6 ways\n\nUsing the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, we add the ways in which an odd number of employees get no jobs and subtract the ways in which an even number of employees get no jobs.\n\nTotal ways = 5^6 - [C(5,1)*4^6 - C(5,2)*3^6 + C(5,3)*2^6 - C(5,4)*1^6]\n\nCalculating these values, we get:\n\nTotal ways = 15625 - [5*4096 - 10*729 + 10*64 - 5*1] = 15625 - [20480 - 7290 + 640 - 5] = 15625 - 13815 = 1810 ways.\n\nSo, there are 1810 ways to assign 6 jobs to 5 employees such that every job is assigned to just one employee and at least one job should be given to each employee.", "1#2#": "(a) If there are no restrictions on the number of jobs that can be given to a single employee, then each job can be assigned to any of the five employees. So, for each job, there are 5 possibilities. Since there are 3 jobs, the total number of ways to assign the jobs is 5^3 = 125.\n\n(b) If we have to assign six jobs to five employees such that each employee gets at least one job, it's a bit more complicated. This is a problem of distributing distinct items (jobs) into distinct groups (employees) such that no group is empty. This can be solved using the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nFirst, consider all ways to distribute the jobs, without the restriction that each employee gets at least one job. That's 5^6 = 15625 ways.\n\nFrom this, we subtract the number of ways to distribute the jobs such that at least one employee gets no job. There are 5 ways to choose which employee gets no job, and then 4^6 = 4096 ways to distribute the jobs among the remaining 4 employees. So there are 5*4096 = 20480 ways to distribute the jobs such that at least one employee gets no job.\n\nHowever, we've now subtracted too much, because we've subtracted cases where two employees get no job twice. There are (5 choose 2) = 10 ways to choose which two employees get no job, and then 3^6 = 729 ways to distribute the jobs among the remaining 3 employees. So there are 10*729 = 7290 ways to distribute the jobs such that at least two employees get no job.\n\nContinuing in this way, we get the final answer by the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:\n\n5^6 - 5*4^6 + 10*3^6 - 10*2^6 + 5*1^6 = 15625 - 20480 + 7290 - 640 + 5 = 800.", "2#1#": "(a) If there are three jobs and five employees and every job is assigned to just one employee, but there is no restriction on the number of jobs (even none) that can be given to a single employee, then there are 5^3 = 125 ways to assign the jobs.\n\n(b) If there are six jobs and five employees and every job is assigned to just one employee, and at least one job should be given to each employee, this is a more complex problem. First, each of the 5 employees gets 1 job, leaving 1 job. The remaining job can be assigned to any of the 5 employees. So there are 5^1 = 5 ways to assign the remaining job. But we also need to consider the ways to assign the first five jobs among the five employees. Since order matters (i.e., giving job 1 to employee A and job 2 to employee B is different from giving job 2 to employee A and job 1 to employee B), this is a permutation problem. There are 5! (5 factorial) ways to assign the first five jobs, which is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120. Therefore, the total number of ways to assign six jobs to five employees, with each employee getting at least one job, is 120 * 5 = 600."}
