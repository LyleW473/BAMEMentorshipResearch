This situation is a multi-combination or combination with repetition. The formula is C(n+r-1, r) where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts.

There are 8 ways for all donuts to be of the same kind (one for each variety), so we subtract this from the total number of unrestricted cases. So, the answer is 792 - 8 = 784.", "1#3#5#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this implies that each donut chosen must be of a different variety. However, we want to choose 6 donuts and there are only 8 varieties. This is a combination problem and the solution will be given by the formula for combinations which is C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!]. Where n is the number of items to choose from (8 varieties) and r is the number of items to choose (6 donuts). So, the number of ways is C(8, 6) = 8! / [6!(8-6)!] = 28.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then each donut can be chosen independently of the others and can be any of the 8 varieties. This is a problem of combinations with repetitions which is solved by the formula C(n + r - 1, r). Here, n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6).

That means we only need to decide on the other 3 donuts, which can be any of the 8 varieties (including potentially more blueberry). This is also a problem of combinations with repetitions and is solved by the same formula as above.

Therefore, the answer is 0. \n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, you can choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties in any combination. This is a case of picking with replacement, so the formula to use is (n+r-1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts you want to choose (6). So, the calculation would be (8+6-1) choose 6 = 13 choose 6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(f) This case is a bit more complex because it involves a restriction on one of the varieties. One way to approach this is to consider the different cases separately: \n\n- Case 1: No blueberry-filled donuts. This is equivalent to choosing 6 donuts from 7 varieties (since we're excluding the blueberry-filled donuts), which is (7+6-1) choose 6 = 792 ways.\n  \n- Case 2: One blueberry-filled donut. This is equivalent to choosing 5 donuts from 7 varieties (since one of the donuts is already chosen), which is (7+5-1) choose 5 = 792 ways.\n  \n- Case 3: Two blueberry-filled donuts. This is equivalent to choosing 4 donuts from 7 varieties (since two of the donuts are already chosen), which is (7+4-1) choose 4 = 330 ways.\n\nAdding up these cases, we find that there are a total of 792 + 792 + 330 = 1914 ways.", "1#4#2#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, that means each donut is a different variety. Since we only need 6 donuts and we have 8 varieties to choose from, we're simply choosing 6 out of 8. This is a combination problem, so we use the combination formula nCr = n! / [r!(n-r)!]. Here, n is the number of total varieties (8), and r is the number of donuts we need to choose (6). So, we get:\n\n8C6 = 8! / [6!(8-6)!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, we only need to choose 1 variety out of the 8 available. This is a simpler problem, and we can simply say there are 8 ways to choose, because there are 8 varieties.\n\n(c) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, it's a bit more complicated. First, consider that all donuts could be of the same variety, which we know from part (b) is 8 ways. Then, consider that there could be 2 varieties, 3 varieties, up to 6 varieties in the bag. For each of these cases, we need to consider the ways to choose the varieties, and then for each of those, the ways to divide 6 donuts among the chosen varieties.\n\nHowever, a simpler way to calculate this is to find the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties (with repetition), which is 8+6-1C6 = 13C6 = 1716 ways. \n\nThen, subtract the 8 ways where all donuts are of the same variety (from part (b)). \n\nSo, there are 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties such that there are at least two varieties in the bag.", "1#4#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this means each donut must be a different variety.

If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, there are quite a few possibilities. You could have 5 donuts of one variety and 1 of another, 4 of one variety and 2 of another, and so on. Calculating all these possibilities would be complex and would require a detailed understanding of combinatorics.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then each of the 6 donuts can be of any of the 8 varieties. This is a problem of combinations with repetition. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations with repetition: (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6). \n\nUsing this formula, the calculation would be: (8 + 6 - 1) choose 6 = 13 choose 6 = 1716 ways.", "1#4#5#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, that means each donut is unique. However, you want to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties, it's not possible to do so without repeating some varieties. \n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then there's no restriction on how many donuts of each variety we can choose. This is just like selecting 6 donuts from 8 varieties, and we can have repeated varieties. So, we're looking at a multiset, or combination with repetition. The formula for that is C(n+r-1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts we want to choose. So, we have C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we've already chosen 3 of the 6 donuts. We need to choose the remaining 3 from the 8 varieties (including the blueberry-filled, since we can still choose more of this kind). Using the same formula as above, we have C(8+3-1, 3) = C(10, 3) = 120 ways.", "1#4#6#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this means we can only pick one donut from each variety. Since we need 6 donuts, but there are 8 varieties, this is a combination problem. We use the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / r!(n-r)!, where n is the total number of varieties and r is the number of donuts we need. So, C(8, 6) = 8! / 6!(8-6)! = 28 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this means we cannot have all the donuts of the same variety. We have 8^6 total ways to fill the bag (since for each of the 6 donuts, we have 8 choices). However, this count includes the ways where all the donuts are of the same variety. There are 8 such ways (one for each variety). So, the number of ways to choose the donuts is 8^6 - 8 = 262,136.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we need to consider different cases separately: no blueberry donut, one blueberry donut, and two blueberry donuts.\n\n- No blueberry donut: We need to choose all 6 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. This is 7^6 = 117,649 ways.\n- One blueberry donut: We choose 1 donut from the blueberry variety and the remaining 5 from the 7 other varieties. This is 1 * 7^5 = 16,807 ways.\n- Two blueberry donuts: We choose 2 donuts from the blueberry variety and the remaining 4 from the 7 other varieties. This is C(2,2) * 7^4 = 2,401 ways.\n\nAdd these all up, we have 117,649 + 16,807 + 2,401 = 136,857 ways.", "1#5#2#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, it's not possible to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties. Each variety would only contribute 1 donut to the bag, so you could only ever have a maximum of 8 donuts in the bag. \n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to do this. This is because there are 8 varieties of donuts, and choosing all 6 donuts from one variety counts as one way.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, there are several possibilities. \n\n- Three blueberry donuts and the other three donuts are all different varieties. This would be 5 choose 3 ways (10 ways).\n- Four blueberry donuts, and the other two are different varieties. This would be 5 choose 2 ways (10 ways).\n- Five blueberry donuts, and the other donut is of any other variety. This would be 5 choose 1 ways (5 ways).\n- Six blueberry donuts. This would be 1 way. \n\nSo in total, there are 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 26 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts with at least three blueberry-filled donuts.", "1#5#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, it means you are choosing 6 different types of donuts from 8 available. This is a combination problem, as the order in which you choose the donuts does not matter. The number of ways to do this can be calculated by the formula for combinations: C(n, r) = n! / [(n-r)! * r!], where n is the total number of items to choose from, r is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial. Therefore, the number of ways is C(8, 6) = 8! / [(8-6)! * 6!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then you are guaranteed to have 3 of one type. You then have to choose the remaining 3 from the remaining 7 varieties (as one variety - blueberry - has already been chosen). This is again a combination problem, and the number of ways is C(7, 3) = 7! / [(7-3)! * 3!] = 35 ways. However, this only accounts for exactly 3 blueberry donuts. You also have to consider the cases where there could be 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts. For each of these cases, you would choose the remaining 2, 1, or 0 donuts from 7 varieties, respectively. So, you would calculate C(7,2), C(7,1), and C(7,0) and add these to your total from before. Therefore, the total number of ways is 35 (for 3 blueberry donuts) + 21 (for 4 blueberry donuts) + 7 (for 5 blueberry donuts) + 1 (for 6 blueberry donuts) = 64 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then you could have any combination of donuts. This is a problem of combinations with repetition, which can be solved using the formula for combinations with repetition: C(n + r - 1, r) = (n + r - 1)! / [(n - 1)! * r!]. In this case, n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts to choose (6).

So, there are C(8, 6) = 8! / 6!(8-6)! = 28 ways to choose 6 different varieties of donuts out of 8.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can think of the problem in parts. First, we automatically choose 3 blueberry donuts. We then have 3 donuts left to choose, and we can choose these from any of the 8 varieties (including potentially more blueberry). This is a combination with replacement problem, and the formula is C(n+r-1, r) = (n+r-1)! / r!(n-1)!.

First, consider the cases where there are 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts in the bag. For each of these cases, the remaining donuts can be any variety.

The second case is where there are 2 donuts of one variety and 4 donuts each of a different variety. The number of ways to do this is 8 * (7 choose 4) = 560. The final case is where there are 2 donuts of one variety, 2 donuts of another variety, and 2 donuts each of a different variety. The number of ways to do this is (8 choose 2) * (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15*15*6 = 1350.

Using that, C(8, 6) = 8! / [6!(8-6)!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then you are just choosing 1 variety out of 8 to fill all 6 slots in the bag.

Substituting n = 8 and r = 6, we get C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we subtract from the total number of unrestricted choices (1716) the number of ways to have all donuts of the same variety (8). So, there are 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties with at least two varieties in the bag.", "1#4#3#5#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, that means each donut has to be different. However, since we need to choose 6 donuts and there are only 8 varieties, this is not possible. So, the number of ways is 0.\n\n(b) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can consider the opposite scenario where all the donuts are of the same variety. There are 8 ways to choose a single variety. The total ways to choose any assortment of donuts is given by the stars and bars formula, which is (n+k-1 choose k-1), where n is the number of varieties and k is the number of donuts. In this case, it would be (8+6-1 choose 6-1) = (13 choose 5) = 1287. So, the number of ways to have at least two varieties is 1287 - 8 = 1279.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we can use the stars and bars formula again. As explained above, it would be (8+6-1 choose 6-1) = (13 choose 5) = 1287.\n\n(d) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can first choose the 3 blueberry-filled donuts, leaving us with 3 more donuts to choose from any of the 8 varieties. This would be given by the stars and bars formula as (8+3-1 choose 3-1) = (10 choose 2) = 45. So, the number of ways is 45.", "1#4#3#6#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, it means every donut must be of a different type. But you can't choose 6 unique donuts from 8 varieties, because each variety must be different. This situation is impossible, so there are 0 ways.\n\n(b) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, there are many ways to do this. However, you did not provide option (b) in your question. Please provide the details for this scenario.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we are dealing with a problem of combinations with repetition. This type of problem is solved using the formula (n+r-1) choose r, where n is the number of types (8 in this case) and r is the number of items to choose (6 in this case). So the number of ways is C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13,6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider the cases separately where there are 0, 1, and 2 blueberry donuts. The remaining donuts can be of any variety. So, the total ways will be:\n\n- 0 blueberry: C(7+6-1, 6) = C(12,6) = 924 ways\n- 1 blueberry: C(7+5-1, 5) = C(11,5) = 462 ways\n- 2 blueberry: C(7+4-1, 4) = C(10,4) = 210 ways\n\nAdding these up, there are 924 + 462 + 210 = 1596 ways.\n\n(e) You didn't provide option (e) in your question. Please provide the details for this scenario. \n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, this is the same as option (d), so there would be 1596 ways. \n\nPlease note that these calculations assume that there are unlimited donuts of each variety. If the number of donuts of each variety is limited, the calculations would be different.", "1#4#5#2#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it is not possible to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties, as you cannot repeat a variety.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to do this, as you simply choose one variety out of the 8 and fill the bag with 6 donuts of that variety.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then the calculation is a bit more complex. We can consider this as choosing 2 varieties from 8 (which is 8 choose 2 ways) and then choosing 4 more from the remaining 6 varieties + the 2 already chosen (which is 8 choose 4 ways). So, the total ways would be (8 choose 2) * (8 choose 4) = 28 * 70 = 1960 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we have to consider the remaining 3 donuts. These 3 donuts can be of any of the 8 varieties. So, we have (8 choose 1) * (8 choose 1) * (8 choose 1) = 8 * 8 * 8 = 512 ways for the 3 remaining donuts. But we also need to account for the cases where we have 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts. So, the total number of ways would be 512 + (8 choose 1) * (8 choose 1) * 2 + (8 choose 1) + 1 = 512 + 128 + 8 + 1 = 649 ways.", "1#4#5#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, there is no valid way to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties as each bag can only contain one donut of each variety.\n\n(b) You may have mixed up the order of your questions. I'll assume this is the question for \"if there must be at least two varieties in the bag\". This scenario is the same as having no restrictions because even with no restrictions, you would still end up with at least two varieties when picking 6 donuts from 8 varieties. This falls under a principle in combinatorics known as combinations with repetition. Using the formula (n+r-1)C(r), where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6), the calculation is (8+6-1)C(6) = 13C6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(c) This question is supposed to be \"if there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag?\" The answer is the same as the previous one. There would be 1716 ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties even without any restrictions.\n\n(d) You may have mixed up the order of your questions again. I'll assume this is the question for \"if there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag?\" In this case, you have to first pick 3 blueberry-filled donuts, and then you have 3 donuts left to pick from 8 varieties (since you can still pick more blueberry-filled donuts).

So, C(8, 6) = 8! / [6!(8-6)!] = 28 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is basically any possible combination of 6 donuts from the 8 varieties except the 8 situations where all 6 donuts are of the same variety. Total combinations of 6 donuts from 8 varieties is C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716. Subtract the 8 situations where all 6 are the same, we get 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, it means we can have 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts. Each of these cases allows for certain combinations of the remaining donuts. This would require a bit of calculation for each scenario, adding up the results. However, this problem can't be solved without knowing how many blueberry-filled donuts are available.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have four situations: no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, two blueberry donuts, or three blueberry donuts.

So, there are 8 ways to do this.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, it means you cannot have all 6 donuts of the same variety. First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties without restriction. This can be done with replacement, so it's a combination with repetition, calculated using the formula C(n+r-1, r) = (n+r-1)! / [(n-1)!r!]. So, C(8+6-1, 6) = 3003 ways.

This is a combination problem and can be solved using the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / [(r!(n-r)!)]. Here, n = 8 (total number of varieties) and r = 6 (number of donuts we are choosing). Hence, the number of ways is C(8, 6) = 28.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then we are effectively choosing 1 variety out of 8 to fill our bag.

The formula is C(n+r-1, r) where n is the number of types (8) and r is the number of items to choose (6). Hence, the number of ways is C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the case where all donuts are of the same variety (which we already calculated in (b) as 8) from the total number of combinations with repetition (which we calculated in (c) as 1716).

We need to consider combinations of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 varieties. This would require a detailed calculation that considers the possibilities of different combinations.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we first choose 3 blueberry-filled donuts, then choose the remaining 3 donuts from the 8 varieties (including the blueberry).

For one blueberry donut, we have 6 positions where the blueberry donut can be, and the other 5 donuts can be any of the other 7 varieties, which is 6 * 7^5. For two blueberry donuts, we have 6 choose 2 ways to place the blueberry donuts and the remaining 4 can be any of the other 7 varieties, which is 15 * 7^4.

Therefore, the number of ways would be C(8,6) = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then we are essentially choosing 1 variety out of the 8 available.

As such, you can't pick 6 different donuts from 8 varieties without having at least one duplicate.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, there are a few steps to this problem. First, you choose 3 blueberry donuts, which is one way. Then, for the remaining 3 donuts, you can choose from any of the 8 varieties (including blueberry). This would be 8^3 = 512 ways. So in total, there would be 512 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider several cases: 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts. For each case, we choose the remaining donuts from the 7 non-blueberry varieties.

This is a combination with repetition problem, where the formula is C(n+r-1, r). The total number of ways to divide the donuts among the types is C(6+2-1,6), or C(7,6).

This involves a bit more calculation, but the concept is the same: use the multiset coefficient formula for each case and add the results.", "2#3#6#4#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then each variety of donut is a possible selection. Since there are 8 varieties, there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of combinations with repetition, also known as multiset coefficients. The number of combinations of n items taken k at a time with repetition is given by the binomial coefficient (n+k-1 choose k). In this case, we want to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties, so the number of ways is (8+6-1 choose 6) = (13 choose 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we need to consider several cases: no blueberry-filled donuts, one blueberry-filled donut, and two blueberry-filled donuts. In each case, the rest of the donuts can be any variety. So, we sum the possibilities for each case.\n\n- 0 blueberry: (7+6-1 choose 6) = (12 choose 6) = 924 ways.\n- 1 blueberry: (7+5-1 choose 5) = (11 choose 5) = 462 ways.\n- 2 blueberry: (7+4-1 choose 4) = (10 choose 4) = 210 ways.\n\nSo there are 924 + 462 + 210 = 1596 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can find this by subtracting the cases where all the donuts are the same variety (which we found in part (b)) from the total number of unrestricted cases (which we found in part (c)).

This is because each of the 8 varieties can fill a bag.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, you would use the formula for combinations with repetition, which is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. In this case, it would be (8 + 6 - 1) choose 6, which equals 792 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider different cases: no blueberry-filled donuts, one blueberry-filled donut, and two blueberry-filled donuts.

The total number of unrestricted ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties is given by the combination formula \"8 choose 6\", which equals 28. Subtracting the 8 ways where all donuts are of the same variety, we get 20 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts with at least two different varieties.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it is not possible to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties.

The total number of ways to choose 6 donuts out of 8 varieties (with replacement) is 8^6 = 262,144.

The ways to choose all of the same variety is 8 (as calculated above). So, the ways to choose with at least two varieties is 8^6 - 8.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider cases of 0, 1, and 2 blueberry-filled donuts separately.\n\n0 blueberry-filled: This is equivalent to choosing 6 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which is 7^6 ways.\n\n1 blueberry-filled: This is equivalent to choosing 5 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which is 7^5 ways, but this can be done in 6 different orders (the blueberry-filled donut can be in any of the six positions), so it's 6*7^5.\n\n2 blueberry-filled: This is equivalent to choosing 4 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which is 7^4 ways, but this can be done in 15 different orders (the two blueberry-filled donuts can be in any pair of the six positions), so it's 15*7^4.\n\nSo, the total number of ways in this case is 7^6 + 6*7^5 + 15*7^4.", "2#4#3#1#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then you are simply choosing 6 different donuts out of 8.

As calculated above, there are 3003 ways with no restrictions, and 8 ways with only one variety, so there are 3003 - 8 = 2995 ways with at least two varieties.", "2#4#3#5#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose a bag. This is because you can choose 6 donuts from any of the 8 varieties, so you just count the number of varieties.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, it's more complex. There are 8 ways to choose one variety, and 7 ways to choose a second variety. But the numbers of donuts of each variety can vary: it could be 5 of one kind and 1 of another, 4 of one kind and 2 of another, etc. So, you'll need to calculate each of these combinations separately and then add them together. This requires some knowledge of combinatorial mathematics.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, you're looking for the number of ways to distribute 6 identical objects (the donuts) into 8 distinct boxes (the varieties). This is a problem of combinations with repetition, and the solution is given by the binomial coefficient (8+6-1) choose 6, which equals 1716.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you subtract the cases where there are 0, 1, or 2 blueberry-filled donuts from the total number of unrestricted cases. For 0 blueberry-filled donuts, it's (8-1+6-1) choose 6 = 792. For 1 blueberry-filled donut, it's (8-1+6-2) choose (6-1) = 792. For 2 blueberry-filled donuts, it's (8-1+6-3) choose (6-2) = 792. Subtracting these from the total gives 1716 - 3*792 = -660, which doesn't make sense, suggesting an error in the calculation. Instead, consider the problem as choosing 3 blueberry-filled donuts (1 way), and then choosing the other 3 donuts from any of the 8 varieties, which is (8+3-1) choose 3 = 120. Therefore, there are 120 ways to choose a bag with at least 3 blueberry-filled donuts.", "2#4#3#6#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts. This is because there are 8 varieties to choose from, and you are choosing all 6 donuts from one variety. \n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is a little more complicated. First, we can choose 2 varieties from 8, which is 8 choose 2, or 28 ways. For each of those 28 ways, we can choose how many donuts of each variety to include in the bag. This is a problem of distributing 6 indistinguishable items into 2 distinguishable bins, which has (6+2-1) choose 2, or 21 ways. So, there are 28*21 = 588 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts with at least two varieties. But we need to subtract the cases where all 6 donuts are of one variety, which is 8 ways as we calculated in part (b). So, there are 588 - 8 = 580 ways if there must be at least two varieties in the bag.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of distributing 6 indistinguishable items into 8 distinguishable bins. The number of ways to do this is (6+8-1) choose 6, or 13 choose 6, which is 1716 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we have a few cases to consider. We could have 0, 1, or 2 blueberry-filled donuts. If we have 0 blueberry-filled donuts, then we are choosing 6 donuts from 7 varieties, which is (6+7-1) choose 6, or 792 ways. If we have 1 blueberry-filled donut, then we are choosing 5 donuts from 7 varieties, which is (5+7-1) choose 5, or 792 ways. If we have 2 blueberry-filled donuts, then we are choosing 4 donuts from 7 varieties, which is (4+7-1) choose 4, or 330 ways. So, there are 792 + 792 + 330 = 1914 ways if there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag.", "2#4#5#1#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, that means you're choosing one donut from each of six different varieties out of eight. This can be done in C(8,6) ways, where C(n,k) is the binomial coefficient (the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items). C(8,6) is equal to 28.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, that means you're choosing one variety out of eight and taking all six donuts from that variety. This can be done in 8 ways (one for each variety).\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, it's easier to calculate the total number of ways to choose six donuts (which is 8^6 = 262144, because you have 8 choices for each of the 6 donuts) and subtract the number of ways with only one variety (which we already calculated as 8). So the answer is 262144 - 8 = 262136.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you need to consider three cases: exactly three, four, or five blueberry donuts.\n\n- If there are exactly three blueberry donuts, the other three can be any of the other 7 varieties, which can be done in 7^3 = 343 ways.\n- If there are exactly four blueberry donuts, the other two can be any of the other 7 varieties, which can be done in 7^2 = 49 ways.\n- If there are exactly five blueberry donuts, the other one can be any of the other 7 varieties, which can be done in 7^1 = 7 ways.\n\nSo the total number of ways is 343 + 49 + 7 = 399.", "2#4#5#3#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts.

The total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties without restriction is a combination denoted as C(8+6-1,6) = C(13,6) = 1716. Now, subtract the 8 ways where all donuts are of the same variety: 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you could think of it this way: choose 3 blueberry donuts and then choose the other 3 from any of the 8 varieties.

The simplest case would be two varieties with 3 donuts each. Using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the number of items to choose from, and k is the number to choose, we have C(8,2) for choosing the 2 varieties, and then 1 way to distribute the 6 donuts.

We'll need to sum these cases:\n\n- 0 blueberry-filled: C(7, 6) + 7 (for the 7 ways to choose 6 of a single variety)\n- 1 blueberry-filled: C(7, 5) * 7\n- 2 blueberry-filled: C(7, 4) * 7^2\n\nThis sum gives the total number of ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts with no more than 2 blueberry-filled donuts.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, you would consider all the combinations of 6 donuts from 8 varieties, then subtract the 8 ways where all 6 donuts are the same variety. So the total would be C(8, 6) - 8.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we consider three cases: 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts. For each case, the remaining donuts can be of any variety. This is a similar calculation to part (f), but the cases we sum are:\n\n- 3 blueberry-filled: C(7, 3) * 7^3\n- 4 blueberry-filled: C(7, 2) * 7^2\n- 5 blueberry-filled: C(7, 1) * 7\n- 6 blueberry-filled: 1 (only one way to have all donuts be blueberry-filled)\n\nThis sum gives the total number of ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts with at least three blueberry-filled donuts.", "2#6#5#1#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose the donuts because there are 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, the problem becomes more complex. There are various combinations, for example, 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts, and the remaining donuts can be of any variety. This would be the sum of the combinations of choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties with 0, 1, or 2 blueberry-filled donuts. This would be a bit complex to calculate without more specific details.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, again the problem becomes more complex. There are various combinations, for example, 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts, and the remaining donuts can be of any variety. This would be the sum of the combinations of choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties with 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts. This would be a bit complex to calculate without more specific details.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then you can only choose 6 out of the 8 varieties, and there's only one way to choose each variety. This is a combination problem. The number of ways to choose 6 varieties out of 8 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [(n-k)!k!], where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes factorial. In this case, n=8 and k=6, so the number of ways is C(8, 6) = 8! / [(8-6)!6!] = 28 ways.", "2#6#5#3#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then each variety of donut represents one way to fill the bag. So, there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, it is a bit more complicated. You have 3 scenarios: no blueberry donut, one blueberry donut, or two blueberry donuts. \n\n- No blueberry donut: You can choose all 6 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7,6)*6^6 ways.\n\n- One blueberry donut: You can choose the remaining 5 from the 7 varieties, which is C(7,5)*7^5 ways.\n\n- Two blueberry donuts: You can choose the remaining 4 from the 7 varieties, which is C(7,4)*7^4 ways.\n\nSo, the total number of ways is C(7,6)*6^6 + C(7,5)*7^5 + C(7,4)*7^4.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you have 4 scenarios: three blueberry donuts, four blueberry donuts, five blueberry donuts, or six blueberry donuts. \n\n- Three blueberry donuts: You can choose the remaining 3 from the 7 varieties, which is C(7,3)*7^3 ways.\n\n- Four blueberry donuts: You can choose the remaining 2 from the 7 varieties, which is C(7,2)*7^2 ways.\n\n- Five blueberry donuts: You can choose the remaining 1 from the 7 varieties, which is C(7,1)*7 ways.\n\n- Six blueberry donuts: You can choose all 6 from blueberry variety, which is 1 way.\n\nSo, the total number of ways is C(7,3)*7^3 + C(7,2)*7^2 + C(7,1)*7 + 1.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, each of the 6 donuts can be any of the 8 varieties. So there are 8^6 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties.", "2#6#5#4#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts. This is because there are 8 varieties and you're choosing one variety to fill the entire bag.\n\n(f) For this problem, we need to consider different scenarios. First, there could be no blueberry-filled donuts in the bag. Second, there could be one blueberry-filled donut. Third, there could be two blueberry-filled donuts. For each scenario, the remaining donuts can be any variety. \n\n- 0 blueberry donuts: We choose 6 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which gives us C(7+6-1, 6) = C(12,6) = 924 ways.\n- 1 blueberry donut: We choose 5 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which gives us C(7+5-1, 5) = C(11,5) = 462 ways.\n- 2 blueberry donuts: We choose 4 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which gives us C(7+4-1, 4) = C(10,4) = 210 ways.\n\nSo in total, there are 924 + 462 + 210 = 1596 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we have three scenarios: three, four, five or six blueberry-filled donuts. \n\n- 3 blueberry donuts: We choose 3 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which gives us C(7+3-1, 3) = C(9,3) = 84 ways.\n- 4 blueberry donuts: We choose 2 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which gives us C(7+2-1, 2) = C(8,2) = 28 ways.\n- 5 blueberry donuts: We choose 1 donut from the remaining 7 varieties, which gives us C(7+1-1, 1) = C(7,1) = 7 ways.\n- 6 blueberry donuts: This is just 1 way.\n\nSo in total, there are 84 + 28 + 7 + 1 = 120 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is equivalent to subtracting the ways with only one variety (which we found in part b) from the total ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties, which is C(8+6-1,6) = C(13,6) = 1716 ways. Therefore, there are 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.", "3#1#2#4#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then we cannot choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties because it would mean we have at least two donuts of the same kind. So there are 0 ways in this case.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then we are essentially choosing one variety out of the 8 available to fill the bag. So, there are 8 ways to do this.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of combinations with repetition. This can be calculated using the formula for combination with repetition: C(n + r - 1, r) = C(n + r - 1, n - 1). Here n is the number of types of donuts (8) and r is the number of donuts to choose (6). So, we have C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we would subtract the number of ways all the donuts could be of the same type (which we calculated in part b as 8) from the total number of ways with no restrictions (which we calculated in part c as 1716). So, there are 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.", "3#1#2#5#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, that means you can only pick one donut from each variety. But since you need 6 donuts and there are only 8 varieties, the number of ways to choose the donuts is the number of ways to choose 6 varieties out of 8, which is a combination problem. The formula for combination is C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!]. In this case, n=8 and r=6. So the number of ways is C(8, 6) = 8! / [6!(8-6)!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, that means you are picking all 6 donuts from one variety. Since there are 8 varieties to choose from, the number of ways to do this is simply 8.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then this is a problem of choosing 6 donuts from 8 types with replacement (since you can choose the same type more than once). This is a combination with replacement problem, and the formula is C(n+r-1, r) = (n+r-1)! / [r!(n-1)!]. In this case, n=8 and r=6. So the number of ways is C(8+6-1, 6) = 13! / [6!(13-6)!] = 1716 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, that means you are picking 3 donuts of one variety (blueberry) and the remaining 3 donuts from any of the 8 varieties (including blueberry). The number of ways to choose the remaining 3 donuts (with replacement) is C(8+3-1, 3) = 10! / [3!(10-3)!] = 120 ways. However, since you could also have 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts, you need to calculate these possibilities as well and add them together. So the total number of ways is 120 (for 3 blueberry donuts) + C(8+2-1, 2) (for 4 blueberry donuts) + C(8+1-1, 1) (for 5 blueberry donuts) + C(8+0-1, 0) (for 6 blueberry donuts) = 120 + 36 + 8 + 1 = 165 ways.", "3#1#2#6#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, that means we can't pick the same variety twice. So, we need to choose 6 different varieties out of 8. This is a combination problem. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of different items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial. So we have C(8, 6) = 8! / [6!(8-6)!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then we are essentially choosing 1 variety out of 8 to fill the bag. This is also a combination problem, but simpler. We have C(8, 1) = 8 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this becomes a problem of combinations with repetition, also known as a multiset. The formula to calculate this is C(n + k - 1, k) = (n + k - 1)! / [k!(n - 1)!]. In this case, n is the number of varieties (8) and k is the number of donuts (6).

Since this is not possible, there are 0 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the number of ways to choose all donuts of the same variety from the total number of ways to choose donuts. There are 8 ways to choose all donuts of the same variety (one for each variety), so the number of ways to choose at least two varieties is 1716 - 8 = 1708.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are as many ways as there are varieties.

So the calculation would be (8+6-1) choose 6, which equals 3003 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this becomes a simple combination problem. Since there are 8 varieties and we want to choose 6, the formula is 8 choose 6, which equals 28 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we need to consider all the combinations minus the combinations with only one variety. The total combinations are (8+6-1) choose 6 = 3003 (from previous calculation). The combinations with only one variety are 8 (8 varieties to choose from).

The number of ways is (7+1-1) choose 1 = 7 ways.\n- For exactly 6 blueberry donuts, we have 6 blueberry donuts and 0 other donuts. The number of ways is 1.\n\nAdding all these up gives 84 + 28 + 7 + 1 = 120 ways.", "3#1#4#6#": "(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag:\nThe problem is equivalent to the number of ways to distribute 6 identical items (the donuts) into 8 distinct boxes (the varieties). This is a well-known problem in combinatorics and is solved by using the stars and bars method. The formula for this is (n+k-1 choose k-1), where n is the number of items and k is the number of boxes.

So, we have 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag:\nThis problem is slightly more complex. We need to consider three cases: when there are no blueberry-filled donuts, one blueberry-filled donut, or two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag.\n\n- If there are no blueberry-filled donuts, the number of ways to fill the bag is (7+6-1 choose 6) = (12 choose 6) = 924.\n- If there is one blueberry-filled donut, the number of ways to fill the rest of the bag is (7+5-1 choose 5) = (11 choose 5) = 462.\n- If there are two blueberry-filled donuts, the number of ways to fill the rest of the bag is (7+4-1 choose 4) = (10 choose 4) = 210.\n\nAdding these up gives us 924 + 462 + 210 = 1596 ways.", "3#1#5#2#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this means each donut must be different.

This is a combinatorics problem and can be solved by using the stars and bars method. The number of ways is C(6 + 8 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can subtract the number of ways to choose all donuts of the same variety from the total ways with no restrictions. As in part (b), there are 8 ways to choose all donuts of the same variety.

The total cases of choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties with repetition is given by the combination with repetition formula C(n+r-1, r) = (n+r-1)! / [r!(n-1)!].

There are 8 ways for this to happen (one for each variety), so the answer is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider 3 scenarios: exactly 3, 4, or 5 blueberry donuts. For each scenario, the remaining donuts can be any variety. So, the total is (8+3-1 choose 3) + (8+2-1 choose 2) + (8+1-1 choose 1), which is 120 + 36 + 8 = 164 ways. If it's possible to have all 6 donuts as blueberry-filled, then we need to add 1 more way, making it 165 ways.", "4#1#3#6#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, that means each donut is a different variety. But since we are choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties, this is impossible because we would only be able to choose 8 different varieties at most. So, the answer to this scenario is 0.\n\n(b) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we are dealing with a problem of combinations with repetition. This can be solved using the formula (n + r - 1)C(r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So, we get (8 + 6 - 1)C(6) = 13C6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(c) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can subtract the ways of having all 6 donuts of the same variety from the total ways of choosing 6 donuts. There are 8 ways to choose all 6 donuts of the same variety (one for each variety), so the answer would be 1716 (from part b) - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(d) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we need to consider several cases: no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, and two blueberry donuts. These cases would be added together for the final answer.\n\n- No blueberry: (7 + 6 - 1)C6 = 792 ways\n- One blueberry: (7 + 5 - 1)C5 = 462 ways\n- Two blueberries: (7 + 4 - 1)C4 = 210 ways\n\nSo, there are 792 + 462 + 210 = 1464 ways.", "4#1#5#2#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, the number of ways to choose the bag is 0. This is because it's impossible to choose 6 donuts with no two of the same kind from only 8 varieties.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, the number of ways to choose the bag is 8. This is because there are 8 varieties of donuts and each variety can fill a bag.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, the total number of ways to choose the bag can be calculated as the total ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties minus the ways in which all donuts are of the same variety. The total ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 is given by the combination formula (8 choose 6) = 28. Subtracting the 8 ways in which all donuts are of the same variety gives 20 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can think of this in terms of cases. One case is when there are exactly 3 blueberry donuts, one case is when there are exactly 4, one case is when there are exactly 5, and one case is when all 6 are blueberry. For each of these cases, the remaining donuts can be any variety. The total is the sum of (5 choose 3) + (5 choose 2) + (5 choose 1) + (5 choose 0) = 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 26 ways.", "4#1#5#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it is impossible to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties, because each variety can only be chosen once.\n\n(b) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, the problem becomes a combination with repetition problem. The formula for combinations with repetition is (n+r-1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So the number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties is C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(c) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we need to subtract the 8 ways of having all 6 donuts be of the same variety (one for each variety) from the total calculated in (b). So the answer is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider this as first choosing 3 blueberry-filled donuts, and then choosing the remaining 3 from any of the 8 varieties (including blueberry). So the number of ways is C(8+3-1, 3) = C(10, 3) = 120 ways.", "4#1#5#6#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this means that you can only choose one donut from each variety. Given that there are 8 varieties and you need to choose 6 donuts, the number of ways is the number of ways to choose 6 varieties from 8, which is a combination problem. So, the number of ways is C(8, 6) = 28 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, the problem becomes the number of ways to distribute 6 donuts into at least 2 of the 8 boxes (varieties). This is a problem of distributing identical objects into distinct boxes with at least one object in each box. The number of ways can be calculated using the Stirling numbers of the second kind, but it's complicated as we need to sum up cases from 2 to 6. However, it's easier to calculate the total ways without restriction and then subtract the ways with only one variety. The total ways without restriction is C(6+8-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716. The ways with only one variety is simply 8 (for 8 varieties). So the number of ways is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, this is equivalent to first choosing 3 blueberry donuts and then choosing the remaining 3 donuts from the 8 varieties (including blueberry). The number of ways is C(6+8-1-3, 3) = C(10, 3) = 120 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, this is equivalent to summing up the ways of choosing 0, 1, 2 blueberry donuts and then choosing the remaining donuts from the 8 varieties. The number of ways is C(6+8-1, 6) + C(6+8-1-1, 5) + C(6+8-1-2, 4) = 1716 + 792 + 330 = 2838 ways.", "4#1#6#2#": "(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we first calculate all possibilities and then subtract the possibilities where all donuts are of the same variety. The total number of ways to choose 6 donuts out of 8 varieties is calculated using the formula for combinations with repetitions, which is (n+r-1)C(r) = (8+6-1)C(6) = 13C6 = 1716. The number of ways to choose all 6 donuts of the same variety is simply the number of varieties, 8. So, the number of ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties with at least two varieties in the bag is 1716 - 8 = 1708.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this is not possible because we are trying to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties but we cannot have any duplicates.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider 3 separate cases: no blueberry-filled donuts, one blueberry-filled donut, and two blueberry-filled donuts. For each case, we find the number of ways to fill the rest of the bag with the remaining varieties. Adding all these possibilities together, we get: \n- 0 blueberry: 7C6 = 7 ways\n- 1 blueberry: 7C5 = 21 ways\n- 2 blueberry: 7C4 = 35 ways\nSo the total number of ways is 7 + 21 + 35 = 63.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to do this because there are 8 different varieties to choose from.", "4#1#6#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, there are 0 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties. This is because you cannot have 6 different varieties of donuts if you are only allowed to choose from 8 varieties and you can't have two of the same variety.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, you can use the combination formula which is nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!. This gives us 8C6 = 8! / 6!(8-6)! = 28 ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties. However, this includes the cases where all donuts are of the same type, which we don't want, so we subtract these cases. There are 8 ways to choose all donuts of the same type (since there are 8 types). So the final answer is 28 - 8 = 20 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider the different cases: no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, and two blueberry donuts. For each case, we can choose the rest of the donuts from the other 7 varieties with no restrictions. Using a Multinomial Coefficient, there are (6+7-1)C6 = 792 ways when there are no blueberry donuts, (5+7-1)C5 = 792 ways when there is one blueberry donut, and (4+7-1)C4 = 330 ways when there are two blueberry donuts. Adding these up, there are 792 + 792 + 330 = 1914 ways in total.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we can use a Multinomial Coefficient to calculate the number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties. This gives us (6+8-1)C6 = (13)C6 = 1716 ways.", "4#1#6#5#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, that means you can only choose one donut from each variety. Since you need to choose 6 donuts and there are 8 varieties, the number of ways is the number of ways to choose 6 varieties from 8, which is a combination of 8 choose 6 = 28 ways. \n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this would be the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties minus the 8 ways of choosing all six donuts from the same variety. The total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties is a combination with repetition, calculated as (8+6-1) choose 6 = 3003 ways. So, the number of ways with at least two varieties is 3003 - 8 = 2995 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider three scenarios: no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, and two blueberry donuts. The total number of ways is the sum of these three scenarios. For no blueberry donuts, the number of ways is (7+6-1) choose 6 = 792 ways. For one blueberry donut, the number of ways is (7+5-1) choose 5 = 792 ways. For two blueberry donuts, the number of ways is (7+4-1) choose 4 = 330 ways. Therefore, the total number of ways is 792 + 792 + 330 = 1914 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider four scenarios: three blueberry donuts, four blueberry donuts, five blueberry donuts, and six blueberry donuts. The total number of ways is the sum of these four scenarios. For three blueberry donuts, the number of ways is (7+3-1) choose 3 = 84 ways. For four blueberry donuts, the number of ways is (7+2-1) choose 2 = 28 ways. For five blueberry donuts, the number of ways is (7+1-1) choose 1 = 7 ways. For six blueberry donuts, the number of ways is (7+0-1) choose 0 = 1 way.

Therefore, there are 8 ways to do this.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we are dealing with a problem of combinations with repetition. The formula for this is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties (8 in this case) and r is the number of donuts we are choosing (6 in this case).

Given that we need 6 donuts and there are only 8 varieties, this situation is equivalent to choosing 6 varieties from 8, which can be calculated using combinations. \n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / [(n-k)!k!], where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and '!' denotes a factorial. \n\nSo, using this formula, the number of ways to choose 6 donuts with no two of the same variety is C(8, 6) = 8! / [(8-6)!6!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then we are simply choosing 1 variety out of the 8 available.

You could have 2 varieties with 3 donuts of each, 3 varieties with 2, 2, and 2 donuts of each, 3 varieties with 4, 1, and 1 donuts of each, and so on. This problem is a bit more complex and might require more detailed calculations.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, this affects the total number of ways you can choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties. First, calculate the total number of ways without any restrictions (which would be 8^6 = 262144 ways since you can choose any of the 8 varieties for each of the 6 donuts). Then subtract the number of ways where you have 3 or more blueberry-filled donuts.

The total number of ways is C(7+3-1,3)+C(7+2-1,2)+C(7+1-1,1)+C(7+0-1,0)=350.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety:\nThere are 8 varieties, and we need to choose 6 donuts from one variety. Since each variety can be a valid choice, there are 8 ways to choose the donuts.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag:\nThis situation includes cases where there are 0, 1, or 2 blueberry-filled donuts. For each case, we calculate the number of ways to select the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties.

Here, n=8 and r=6. So, C(8, 6) = 8! / [(8-6)!6!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then it's a problem of combination with repetition, which is given by the formula C(n+r-1, r) = (n+r-1)! / [(n-1)!r!]. Here, n=8 and r=6. So, C(8+6-1, 6) = 13! / [7!6!] = 1716 ways.\n\n(c) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we need to subtract from the total ways those combinations that include only one variety. From the total 1716 ways, we subtract the 8 ways of having 6 donuts of the same variety. So, 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we need to consider three blueberry-filled donuts as a given. We are left with choosing 3 donuts from 8 varieties (including blueberry), which is a combination with repetition problem.

The total ways of choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties is the combination 8+6-1 choose 6, which equals 3003. There are 8 ways to choose all 6 donuts from one variety. So, the ways to choose at least two varieties is 3003-8=2995.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we have three cases to consider: exactly 3, 4, or 5 blueberry-filled donuts. For each case, we calculate the ways to fill the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties. Sum all these cases to get the total. \n- For exactly 3 blueberry donuts: 7+3-1 choose 3 = 84 ways.\n- For exactly 4 blueberry donuts: 7+2-1 choose 2 = 28 ways.\n- For exactly 5 blueberry donuts: 7+1-1 choose 1 = 7 ways.\nSo, the total ways are 84+28+7=119.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we can use the combination formula with repetition: (n+r-1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6). So, we have 8+6-1 choose 6 = 3003 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then we simply have 8 ways because there are 8 varieties to choose from.", "4#5#3#6#": "(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, there are 8 ways to choose the first variety, and 7 ways to choose the second. After that, we have 4 more donuts to choose, which can be any variety including the two we've already chosen. This is a combination with repetition problem, and the formula is (n+r-1)C(r), where n is the number of varieties (8 in this case), and r is the number of remaining donuts (4 in this case). So there are 8 * 7 * C(8+4-1, 4) = 56 * C(11, 4) = 56 * 330 = 18,480 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we already know three of the donuts, so we just need to choose the other three. These can be any variety, so this is also a combination with repetition problem. The formula is (n+r-1)C(r), where n is now 8 (since we can still choose more blueberry donuts), and r is 3. So there are C(8+3-1, 3) = C(10, 3) = 120 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a straightforward combination with repetition problem. The formula is (n+r-1)C(r), where n is 8 and r is 6. So there are C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1,716 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we need to consider several cases: no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, or two blueberry donuts. Each of these cases is a combination with repetition problem, and we add the results together.\n\nNo blueberry donuts: C(7+6-1, 6) = C(12, 6) = 924 ways.\nOne blueberry donut: C(7+5-1, 5) = C(11, 5) = 462 ways.\nTwo blueberry donuts: C(7+4-1, 4) = C(10, 4) = 210 ways.\n\nSo in total, there are 924 + 462 + 210 = 1,596 ways.", "4#5#6#1#": "(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can consider two cases: \n\n1. 2 varieties and 4 donuts of one variety and 2 of another.

For two, we choose 4 from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7+4-1, 4) = C(10, 4) = 210 ways, times the C(2,2) = 1 way to choose the two blueberry-filled donuts, so 210 ways. In total, there are 924 + 462 + 210 = 1596 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we can consider three cases: three, four, five and six blueberry-filled donuts in the bag. For three, we choose 3 from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7+3-1, 3) = C(9, 3) = 84 ways. For four, we choose 2 from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7+2-1, 2) = C(8, 2) = 28 ways. For five, we choose 1 from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7+1-1, 1) = C(7, 1) = 7 ways. For six, there is only one way to fill the bag entirely with blueberry-filled donuts. So, in total, there are 84 + 28 + 7 + 1 = 120 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then we are essentially choosing 6 different donuts from 8 varieties.

You subtract the 8 ways of choosing all 6 donuts from the same variety from the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties. \n\nThe total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties (with replacement) is given by the combination with repetition formula, which is C(n + r - 1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. Here, n = 8 and r = 6, so the total number of ways is C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties with at least two varieties is 1716 - 8 = 1708.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag:\n\nThis is equivalent to choosing a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties, but with the restriction that you can choose at most 2 blueberry-filled donuts. \n\nTo solve this, we first find the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties, which is 1716 as calculated above. \n\nThen, we subtract the number of ways to choose 3 or more blueberry-filled donuts.

The formula for this is C(n+k-1, k), where n is the number of varieties and k is the number of donuts.

So, the number of ways is 8C6 = 28.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then we are effectively choosing 1 variety from the 8 available. This is 8C1 = 8.\n\n(c) It seems like you skipped this option.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is somewhat more complex. The simplest case is 2 varieties with 3 donuts each, which can be chosen in 8C2 * (6C3) = 28 * 20 = 560 ways. However, there can also be 3 varieties with 2, 2, and 2 donuts each (8C3 * (6C2 * 4C2) = 56 * 90 = 5040 ways), or 3 varieties with 4, 1, and 1 donuts each (8C3 * (6C4 * 2C1) = 56 * 90 = 5040 ways), or 4 varieties with 3, 1, 1, and 1 donuts each (8C4 * (6C3 * 3C1 * 2C1) = 70 * 60 = 4200 ways), or 5 varieties with 2, 1, 1, 1, and 1 donuts each (8C5 * (6C2 * 4C1 * 3C1 * 2C1) = 56 * 180 = 10080 ways), or 6 varieties with 1 donut each (8C6 = 28 ways). Adding all these up gives 560 + 5040 + 5040 + 4200 + 10080 + 28 = 21948 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, this is equivalent to first choosing 3 blueberry-filled donuts, and then choosing 3 more donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. This can be done in 7C3 = 35 ways. However, we could also have 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts, each of which adds more possibilities. Adding all these up gives 35 + 7C2 + 7C1 + 7C0 = 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64 ways.\n\nPlease note that these calculations assume that there is an unlimited number of donuts of each variety. If there is a limited supply of each variety, the calculations would be more complex.", "5#2#1#6#": "Sure, let's solve these problems:\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, that means each donut in the bag must be of a different variety.

This can be done in 8 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have three cases:\n\n   1. Three blueberry and three of any of the other seven varieties. This can be done in (7 choose 3) ways.\n   2. Four blueberry and two of any of the other seven varieties. This can be done in (7 choose 2) ways.\n   3. Five blueberry and one of any of the other seven varieties. This can be done in (7 choose 1) ways.\n   4. All six are blueberry, which can only be done in 1 way.\n\nSo, in total, we have (7 choose 3) + (7 choose 2) + (7 choose 1) + 1 = 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have four cases:\n\n   1. No blueberry donuts, and six from the other seven varieties. This can be done in (7 choose 6) * (6 choose 6) ways.\n   2. One blueberry donut, and five from the other seven varieties. This can be done in (7 choose 5) * (5 choose 5) ways.\n   3. Two blueberry donuts, and four from the other seven varieties. This can be done in (7 choose 4) * (4 choose 4) ways.\n\nSo, in total, we have (7 choose 6) * (6 choose 6) + (7 choose 5) * (5 choose 5) + (7 choose 4) * (4 choose 4) = 7 + 21 + 35 = 63 ways.\n", "5#2#3#1#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, we are essentially choosing 6 distinct varieties from 8, which is a combination problem.

The formula for this is C(n + r - 1, r), where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6). So, the number of ways is C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 13! / [(13-6)! * 6!] = 1716 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider a few different cases: exactly 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts.

For each case, we calculate the number of ways to choose the rest of the donuts from the remaining varieties. Add up all these cases to get the total number of ways. \n\n  - No blueberry donut: C(7+6-1,6) = C(12,6) = 924.\n  - One blueberry donut: C(7+5-1,5) = C(11,5) = 462.\n  - Two blueberry donuts: C(7+4-1,4) = C(10,4) = 210.\n\nSo the total number of ways is 924 + 462 + 210 = 1596.", "1#2#3#5#4#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this situation is not possible because we need to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties, thus there must be some repetition of at least one variety.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to do this because there are 8 varieties to choose from and we can choose any one of them.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of selecting with replacement. In this case, we use the formula for combinations with repetitions which is (n+r-1)C(r), where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6). Thus, the number of ways is (8+6-1)C(6) = 13C6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we first choose 3 blueberry donuts. For the remaining 3 donuts, we can choose from any of the 8 varieties (including the blueberry). This is a combinations with repetitions problem, so we use the formula (n+r-1)C(r), where n is 8 and r is 3. The number of ways is (8+3-1)C(3) = 10C3 = 120 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can consider it as the total ways without restriction minus the ways with all donuts of the same variety.

This can be calculated as C(n+r-1, r) where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts in the bag. In this case, C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, this can be broken down into three cases: exactly 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts. Each case would then be calculated similarly to (c), with the remaining donuts having 7 possible varieties. Summing these cases gives:\n\n    3 blueberry: C(7+3-1, 3) = C(9, 3) = 84\n    4 blueberry: C(7+2-1, 2) = C(8, 2) = 28\n    5 blueberry: C(7+1-1, 1) = C(7, 1) = 7\n    6 blueberry: C(7+0-1, 0) = C(6, 0) = 1\n    Total = 84 + 28 + 7 + 1 = 120 ways\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, this can be broken down into four cases: exactly 0, 1, or 2 blueberry-filled donuts.

Summing these cases gives:\n\n    0 blueberry: C(7+6-1, 6) = C(12, 6) = 924\n    1 blueberry: C(7+5-1, 5) = C(11, 5) = 462\n    2 blueberry: C(7+4-1, 4) = C(10, 4) = 210\n    Total = 924 + 462 + 210 = 1596 ways", "1#2#3#6#4#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then you cannot choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties as each variety can only be chosen once.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there would be 8 ways, corresponding to the 8 varieties of donuts.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then this is a question of combinations with repetition (also known as multiset coefficients or combinations with replacement). The formula for this is C(n+r-1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts to choose. Plugging in the values, C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is a bit more complex. All possible combinations minus the 8 ways where all donuts are of the same variety gives 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, this is also a bit complex. We can break this down into cases where there are 0, 1, or 2 blueberry-filled donuts and sum up the possibilities. When there are 0 blueberry-filled donuts, we choose 6 from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(12, 6) = 924 ways. When there is 1 blueberry-filled donut, we choose 5 from 7, which is C(11, 5) = 462 ways. When there are 2 blueberry-filled donuts, we choose 4 from 7, which is C(10, 4) = 210 ways.

This is because you can choose 6 donuts of the same variety from any of the 8 varieties.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, the problem becomes one of combinations with repetition. This is also known as a multiset. The formula for this is C(n + r - 1, r) where n is the number of types (8 in this case) and r is the number of items to choose (6 in this case). So the answer is C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we have to consider different cases: no blueberry-filled donuts, one blueberry-filled donut, and two blueberry-filled donuts.

This is a combination problem (since order does not matter), and the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / [(n-k)!k!]. Here, n is the total number of varieties (8) and k is the number of donuts chosen (6). So, C(8, 6) = 8! / [(8-6)!6!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are only as many ways as there are varieties, because you're choosing one variety out of 8. So there are 8 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we consider all possible combinations and subtract the ones where all donuts are of the same variety. Using the combination formula as before, C(8, 6) = 28 ways in total. Subtracting the 8 ways where all donuts are of the same variety, there are 28 - 8 = 20 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of combinations with repetition (also known as combinations with replacement). The formula is C(n + k - 1, k) = (n + k - 1)! / [(n - 1)!k!]. Here, n is the number of varieties (8) and k is the number of donuts chosen (6). So, C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = (8 + 6 - 1)! / [(8 - 1)!6!] = 5005 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we have three cases to consider: exactly 3, 4, or 5 blueberry donuts in the bag (since we can't have all 6 be blueberry, as per the previous parts). We then choose the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties. Summing the combinations for these cases gives the total.

The number of ways to choose these can be calculated using combinations. \n\nFor the 2-4, 4-2, and 5-1 combinations, there are 8 ways to choose the first variety and 7 ways to choose the second variety. So there are 8*7 = 56 ways for each of these scenarios. For the 3-3 scenario, there are 8 ways to choose the first variety and 7 ways to choose the second variety, but since the two varieties are the same, we divide by 2 to avoid double-counting, so there are (8*7)/2 = 28 ways. \n\nAdding these up, we get 56 + 56 + 56 + 28 = 196 ways.\n\n(c) if there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag?\nSince there are no restrictions, each donut can be of any of the 8 varieties. This means that each of the 6 donuts can be chosen in 8 ways, giving us 8^6 = 262,144 ways.\n\n(f) if there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag?\nThere are three cases to consider here: no blueberry-filled donuts, one blueberry-filled donut, or two blueberry-filled donuts. In each case, the remaining donuts can be any variety.\n\n- No blueberry-filled: The 6 donuts can be any of the remaining 7 varieties, so 7^6 = 117,649 ways.\n- One blueberry-filled: One of the donuts is blueberry-filled, and the remaining 5 can be any of the 8 varieties, so there are 8^5 = 32,768 ways.\n- Two blueberry-filled: Two of the donuts are blueberry-filled, and the remaining 4 can be any of the 8 varieties, so there are 8^4 = 4,096 ways.\n\nAdding these up, we get 117,649 + 32,768 + 4,096 = 154,513 ways.", "1#2#4#5#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this would mean that you want to choose 6 different varieties from 8 available.

So, the number of ways is 8C6 = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are only as many ways as there are varieties. So, there are 8 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can't have all six donuts of the same variety. This is a bit more complicated. One way to calculate this is to find the total number of combinations (which we'll calculate in part (c)) and subtract the 8 ways in which all donuts could be of the same variety. We'll calculate this after part (c).\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider this as three blueberry donuts already chosen. So, we now need to choose the remaining 3 donuts from 8 varieties (since we can still choose more blueberry donuts).

Here, n = 8 and r = 6, so C(8, 6) = 28.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are only 8 ways. This is because there are 8 varieties and we are choosing only one variety to fill up the bag.\n\n(c) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then there can't be a situation where all donuts are of the same variety. So, subtract the 8 ways of choosing all donuts of the same variety from the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties without any restriction.

The simplest case would be 2 varieties, 3 donuts of each. You can choose two varieties in 8 choose 2 ways (28 ways), and for each choice there is 1 way to split the donuts.

One simple way to think about this is to consider the different ways to distribute 6 items into 2 or more groups, which is a problem of combinations with repetition.

The formula for this is (n+k-1 choose k), where n is the number of varieties (8) and k is the number of donuts (6). So the number of ways is (8+6-1 choose 6) = (13 choose 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we subtract the 8 ways in which all donuts are of the same variety from the total 1716 ways.

In this case, the formula for combinations with repetition is used: C(n+r-1, r) where n is the number of varieties, and r is the number of donuts to choose.

This is because we can select any of the 8 varieties to fill the bag.\n\n(c) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we are left with 3 donuts that can be any of the 8 varieties. So, we can choose 3 donuts from 8 varieties in 8^3 = 512 ways.

That's a more complex calculation that would require additional information.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of combinations with repetition. This can be calculated with the formula for combinations with repetition: C(n + r - 1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So the total number of ways is C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this would be the total number of ways to pick 6 donuts from 8 varieties (which we calculated as 1716 in part c) minus the number of ways to choose 6 donuts all of the same variety (which we calculated as 8 in part b). So the total number of ways is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.", "1#2#6#3#5#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then the number of ways is 0.

We have 3 cases: no blueberry donuts, 1 blueberry donut, 2 blueberry donuts. \n\n- No blueberry donuts: We need to choose 6 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties.

The formula for this is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts you're choosing. So the number of ways is (8 + 6 - 1) choose 6 = 792.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we have to subtract the ways in which only one variety is chosen from the total possibilities. So it's 792 (from part c) - 8 (from part b) = 784 ways.\n\n(f) For no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have three cases to consider: no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, and two blueberry donuts.

This is a problem of combinations with repetition, calculated as C(8+3-1,3) = C(10,3) = 120 ways.", "1#4#2#3#6#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this means each donut in the bag must be of a different variety. Since you can only choose 6 donuts, and each must be unique, this scenario is not possible with 8 varieties of donuts.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then you are essentially choosing 1 variety out of 8. This is a combination problem and the answer is 8 choose 1, which is 8.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of combinations with repetition (also known as combinations with replacement or multiset). The formula for this is (n+r-1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So, it's (8+6-1) choose 6, which is 792.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is more complex. The total number of combinations is 792 as calculated above. However, we must subtract the combinations where all the donuts are of the same variety (which is 8). So, it's 792 - 8 = 784.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, first, we consider the cases where there are 0, 1, or 2 blueberry-filled donuts. For each case, the rest of the donuts can be any variety. So, we add up:\n(7+6-1) choose 6 (no blueberry-filled donuts) +\n(7+5-1) choose 5 (one blueberry-filled donut) +\n(7+4-1) choose 4 (two blueberry-filled donuts).\nThis equals 792 + 792 + 792 = 2376.", "1#4#2#5#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, it is impossible to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties, as each variety can only contribute one donut to the bag.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then the number of ways is simply the number of varieties. As there are 8 varieties, there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then we are dealing with a problem of combinations with repetition. The formula for this is C(n + r - 1, r), where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6). Using this formula, there would be C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can calculate this by finding the total number of ways with no restrictions (1716 from the previous part) and subtracting the number of ways where all donuts are of the same variety (8 from the second part). Therefore, there would be 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can view this as three blueberry donuts plus a bag of three donuts from eight varieties (since the blueberry donuts can be chosen again). This would give us C(8 + 3 - 1, 3) = C(10, 3) = 120 ways.", "1#4#2#5#6#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it's not possible to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties because each donut would need to be a different variety.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to do this because there are 8 varieties to choose from, and you are choosing one variety.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is more complex. There are 8 choose 2 ways to choose the two varieties, and then 6 ways to distribute the donuts among those two varieties. So, the total number of ways is (8 choose 2) * 6 = 28 * 6 = 168 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, there are 8 varieties for the other 3 donuts, which can include blueberry again. This results in (8 choose 3) + (8 choose 2) + (8 choose 1) = 56 + 28 + 8 = 92 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, this would be the total number of ways to fill the bag minus the ways with three or more blueberry-filled donuts. The total number of ways to fill the bag is 8^6 = 262,144 ways. The number of ways with at least three blueberry-filled donuts is calculated similar to part (e), but for 3, 4, 5, and 6 donuts, resulting in (8 choose 3) * 3^3 + (8 choose 4) * 3^2 + (8 choose 5) * 3 + (8 choose 6) = 1344 ways. So, the total is 262,144 - 1344 = 260,800 ways.", "1#4#2#6#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it is not possible to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties because each bag can only have one donut of each variety, which means a maximum of 8 donuts.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties because there are 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then it's a problem of combinations with repetitions. The formula for this is C(n+r-1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So, the number of ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties would be C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we subtract the 8 ways of having all the same variety from the total number of combinations. So, it would be 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider the cases where there are 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts. The total number of combinations would be the sum of these three cases. For each case, we calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties. So, this would be C(12, 6) + C(12, 5) + C(12, 4) = 924 + 792 + 495 = 2211 ways.", "1#4#2#6#5#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, it is not possible to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties because each donut would have to be of a different variety.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to do this because there are 8 different varieties to choose from.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is a complex problem. It would be easier to calculate how many ways there are to choose a bag with only one variety and subtract that from the total ways to choose any bag. The total ways to choose any bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties (where order does not matter and varieties can be repeated) is a combination of 13 choose 6, which is 1716. If we subtract the 8 ways in which all donuts are of the same variety, we get 1708 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can split this into cases. One case is where there are no blueberry donuts, and the other case is where there are one or two blueberry donuts. For the case with no blueberry donuts, there are 7 varieties to choose from, and we can calculate this as a combination of 12 choose 6, which is 924. For the case with one or two blueberry donuts, we can calculate this as (2 choose 1)*(12 choose 5) + (2 choose 2)*(12 choose 4) = 792 + 495 = 1287. Adding these together gives 924 + 1287 = 2211 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can split this into cases based on the number of blueberry donuts. The cases would be 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts. We would calculate these as (4 choose 3)*(8 choose 3) + (4 choose 4)*(8 choose 2) + (4 choose 5)*(8 choose 1) + (4 choose 6)*(8 choose 0), which gives 224 + 70 + 8 + 1 = 303 ways.", "1#4#3#2#5#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it is not possible to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties because you can only select one of each variety.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to do this because there are 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of combinations with repetition. The formula to solve this is C(n+r-1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So, C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the 8 ways of having all of the same variety from the total number of unrestricted selections. So, 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we consider the three scenarios separately: 3, 4, 5, and 6 blueberry donuts. The rest can be any variety. The total number of ways is sum of these 4 scenarios: \n    - 3 blueberry: C(7+3-1,3) = 84\n    - 4 blueberry: C(7+2-1,2) = 21\n    - 5 blueberry: C(7+1-1,1) = 7\n    - 6 blueberry: There's only 1 way to have all blueberry donuts.\nSo, 84 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 113 ways.", "1#4#3#2#6#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it's not possible to choose 6 donuts out of 8 varieties.

The formula for this is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So, it is (8 + 6 - 1) choose 6 = 13 choose 6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can get the total number of unrestricted possibilities and subtract the ways when all donuts are of the same variety.

So, the total number of ways is 8 (as there are 8 varieties to choose from).\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, it is a problem of combinations with repetition. The formula is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties, and r is the number of donuts to be chosen. Here, n=8 and r=6.

So, it's 792 - 8 = 784 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, it means we have to calculate the total number of ways to fill the remaining 3 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. This can be calculated using the formula (n + r - 1) choose r, where n=7 and r=3.

Hence, we have 8^6 - 8 ways to choose.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this means that we can choose any of the 8 varieties of donuts for each of the 6 slots in the bag.

Either there are exactly 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts in the bag. For each case, we choose the remaining donuts from the 7 other varieties.

The total number of ways to select 6 donuts from 8 varieties without any restrictions is 8^6 = 262144. The number of ways with only one variety is 8 (for each of the 8 varieties).

So the number of ways is 1716 - 3*C(10, 7) - 4*C(9, 7) - ... - 6*C(7, 7) = 1666 ways.", "1#4#6#2#5#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, the number of ways is 0. This is because if you can only choose one donut from each variety, you cannot fill a bag of 6 donuts from only 8 varieties.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, the number of ways is 8. This is because there are 8 varieties to choose from and we are choosing all 6 donuts from one variety.\n\n(c) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, the number of ways would be the total ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties minus the ways when all donuts are of the same variety. The total ways can be calculated using the formula for combinations with repetition, which is (n + r - 1) C r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So, the total ways = (8 + 6 - 1) C 6 = 3003. So, the number of ways with at least two varieties = 3003 - 8 = 2995.\n\n(d) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we calculate the total ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties (3003) and subtract the ways when there are more than two blueberry donuts. For 3 to 6 blueberry donuts, we calculate the ways to choose the rest of the donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. This would be a bit complex to calculate.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we calculate the ways to choose the other 3 donuts from all 8 varieties (including blueberry), which is (8 + 3 - 1) C 3 = 120. Then, we subtract the ways when there are no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, or two blueberry donuts. The calculations for these cases would be similar to the case of no more than two blueberry donuts and would be a bit complex. \n\nPlease note that the calculations for cases (d) and (e) would involve multiple steps and may require a more detailed calculation or programming approach.", "1#4#6#3#2#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, it means each donut is a different variety. But you want to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties. This isn't possible because you would need at least 6 different varieties of donuts.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to do this because there are 8 different varieties to choose from.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of combinations with repetition (also known as combinations with replacement or multiset), which is given by the formula (n+k-1 choose k) where n is the number of varieties and k is the number of donuts to choose. So, there are (8+6-1 choose 6) = (13 choose 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the ways when all donuts are the same variety from the total ways with no restrictions. So, the answer is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we need to consider different cases: no blueberry donut, one blueberry donut, and two blueberry donuts. The respective combinations are (7+6-1 choose 6), (7+5-1 choose 5), and (7+4-1 choose 4). Adding these up gives us (12 choose 6) + (11 choose 5) + (10 choose 4) = 924 + 462 + 210 = 1596 ways.", "1#4#6#3#5#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, it means we're choosing 6 different varieties out of 8. This is a combination problem, so we use the combination formula: C(n,r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!). Here, n=8 (total varieties) and r=6 (total donuts to choose). The number of ways to choose is C(8,6) = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this means we can have 1 to 6 varieties. We sum the combinations of choosing from 1 to 6 varieties out of 8. This is the sum C(8,1) + C(8,2) + C(8,3) + C(8,4) + C(8,5) + C(8,6) = 8 + 28 + 56 + 70 + 56 + 28 = 246 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we can choose 6 donuts out of 8 varieties in any way. This is a problem of combinations with repetition, which is solved by the formula: C(n+r-1,r) = (n+r-1)! / r!(n-1)!. Here, n=8 (total varieties) and r=6 (total donuts to choose). The number of ways to choose is C(8+6-1,6) = C(13,6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, this is a bit more complicated. We have to consider different cases: no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, and two blueberry donuts. For each case, we choose the rest of the donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. The total number of ways is: C(7,6) + 7*C(7,5) + 7*7*C(7,4) = 7 + 147 + 735 = 889 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have three cases: three, four, five, or six blueberry donuts. For each case, we choose the rest from the remaining 7 varieties. The total number of ways is: 7*C(7,3) + 7*7*C(7,2) + 7*7*7*C(7,1) + 7*7*7*7*C(7,0) = 245 + 735 + 1029 + 2401 = 4410 ways. \n\nNote: The counts for cases (d) and (e) could be computed in a more straightforward manner if we knew how many donuts of each variety were available, as the calculations above assume an unlimited number of donuts for each variety other than blueberry.", "1#4#6#5#2#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it is not possible to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties because you can only choose one donut from each variety. \n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts because there are 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, there are a lot of combinations. However, the simplest way to calculate this is to calculate the total number of combinations and then subtract the number of combinations where all donuts are of the same variety. There are 8^6 total ways to select 6 donuts from 8 varieties (since each of the 6 donuts can be one of 8 varieties) and we already calculated there are 8 ways to have all the donuts of the same variety. So, 8^6 - 8 = 262,136 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we could have 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts. For each of these cases, we have to calculate the number of ways to select the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties. The total number of ways is 7^6 (all donuts are not blueberry) + 7^5 * 6 (one donut is blueberry) + 7^4 * 15 (two donuts are blueberry) = 117,649 + 168,070 + 150,645 = 436,364 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we could have 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts. For each of these cases, we have to calculate the number of ways to select the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties. The total number of ways is 7^3 * 20 (three donuts are blueberry) + 7^2 * 15 (four donuts are blueberry) + 7 * 6 (five donuts are blueberry) + 1 (all six donuts are blueberry) = 98,560 + 51,725 + 294 + 1 = 150,580 ways.", "1#4#6#5#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then we can't choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties because we can only have one donut from each variety. So, there are 0 ways.\n\n(b) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we choose 2 varieties from 8 (which can be done in 8C2 ways), and then we can fill the rest of the bag in any way, which can be done in 6^6 ways. Thus, the total number of ways is 8C2 * 6^6.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of combinations with repetitions, also known as multiset coefficients or \"combinations with unlimited repetitions\". This can be solved using the formula (n+k-1) choose k, where n is the number of types of donuts, and k is the number of donuts chosen. So the answer is (8+6-1) choose 6 = 13 choose 6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can think of this as the total number of ways to fill the bag with no restrictions (which we calculated in part (c) as 1716 ways), minus the number of ways to fill the bag with three or more blueberry-filled donuts. The number of ways to fill the bag with three or more blueberry-filled donuts is the number of ways to choose 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts, times the number of ways to fill the rest of the bag with any variety of donuts. This is a more complex calculation that would require additional information to solve.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we first choose 3 blueberry-filled donuts (which can be done in 1 way, since we're not distinguishing between the blueberry-filled donuts). Then, we must choose 3 more donuts from any of the 8 varieties, which can be done in (8+3-1) choose 3 = 10 choose 3 = 120 ways. Thus, the total number of ways is 1 * 120 = 120 ways.", "1#5#2#3#4#": "(a) If no two donuts in the bag can be of the same variety, then it is not possible to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties because we would run out of varieties before we reach 6 donuts.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose the bag of donuts because there are 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then we are dealing with combinations with repetition. This is also known as multiset coefficients or \"combinations with replacement\". The formula for this is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties (8 in this case) and r is the number of donuts (6 in this case). Therefore, the number of ways to choose the bag of donuts is (8 + 6 - 1) choose 6 = 13 choose 6 = 1716.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract from the total number of combinations the ways in which all donuts can be of the same variety. So the number of ways is 1716 (from part (c)) - 8 (from part (b)) = 1708.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then there are 3 donuts left to choose freely. We can use the same formula as in part (c) with n = 8 and r = 3. So the number of ways to choose the remaining 3 donuts is (8 + 3 - 1) choose 3 = 10 choose 3 = 120.", "1#5#2#3#6#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, it means you are choosing 6 different types of donuts from 8 varieties. This is a combination problem, and the formula for combinations is C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!], where n is the number of total items (varieties), r is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial. So the answer is C(8, 6) = 8! / [6!(8-6)!] = 28.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 different ways to do this because there are 8 varieties of donuts.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of combinations with repetitions. The formula for this is C(n+r-1, r) = (n+r-1)! / [r!(n-1)!]. In this case, n is the number of varieties (8), and r is the number of donuts (6). So, the answer is C(8+6-1, 6) = 13! / [6!(8-1)!] = 1716.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can break this problem into cases and add them up: three, four, five, or six blueberry-filled donuts.

This is because there are 8 varieties, and you could choose 6 donuts of any one of those varieties.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then this is a combination with repetition problem. The formula for combinations with repetition is (n+r-1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts.

These 3 donuts can be any of the 8 varieties (including potentially more blueberry-filled).

For this problem, n is 8 (the number of donut varieties) and r is 6 (the number of donuts you're choosing). Therefore, C(8, 6) = 8! / [6!(8-6)!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, you simply count the number of varieties, because you're filling the bag with just one kind of donut. In this case, there are 8 ways to fill the bag, corresponding to the 8 different varieties of donuts.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of combinations with repetition, often solved using the stars and bars method.

Using the same formula as in (c), it would be (8+3-1) choose 3 = 10 choose 3 = 120 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you can break it down into cases: no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, two blueberry donuts. Then sum up the results:\n\n- No blueberry: (7+6-1) choose 6 = 792 ways\n- One blueberry: (7+5-1) choose 5 = 792 ways\n- Two blueberry: (7+4-1) choose 4 = 330 ways\n\nSo the total is 792+792+330 = 1914 ways.", "1#5#3#6#4#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this means you can only choose one of each variety. This is impossible as you need to choose 6 donuts but there are only 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(b) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, first we choose 3 blueberry donuts out of 1 blueberry variety, which is 1 way. Then, we need to choose the remaining 3 donuts from the 7 other varieties, which is C(7,3) = 35 ways. Therefore, the total number of ways is 1*35 = 35 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, you can choose any donut from any variety. This is an example of a problem of combinations with repetition. The formula is C(n+r-1,r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts to be chosen. In this case, it is C(8+6-1,6) = C(13,6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is the total ways minus the ways of choosing all 6 donuts from one variety. The total ways is 1716 (from part (c)), and the ways of choosing all 6 donuts from one variety is C(8,1)=8. Therefore, the total number of ways is 1716-8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we need to consider cases when there are 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts. The total ways is the sum of the ways of these three cases. For 0 blueberry donut, it is C(7+6-1,6) = C(12,6) = 924 ways. For 1 blueberry donut, it is C(7+5-1,5) = C(11,5) = 462 ways. For 2 blueberry donuts, it is C(7+4-1,4) = C(10,4) = 210 ways.

This is a combination problem, and the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!]. Here n is the total number of items (8 varieties), and k is the number of items to choose (6 donuts). So the number of ways is C(8, 6) = 8! / [6!(8-6)!] = 28.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, this means we are choosing 1 variety out of 8 to fill the whole bag. So, the number of ways is C(8, 1) = 8.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this means we can choose any variety for each of the 6 donuts.

Each case would be a product of the number of ways to choose the rest of the donuts from the remaining varieties. For example, if there are exactly 3 blueberry-filled donuts, the other 3 donuts can be of any of the 7 remaining varieties. This gives C(7,3)*7^3. Similar calculations apply to the other cases. The total number of ways would be the sum of all these cases.", "1#5#4#2#6#": "(a) If no two donuts in the bag can be of the same variety, then you can't have a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties because you can only select one from each variety which would make a maximum of 8 donuts.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to do this because there are 8 varieties to choose from and you are choosing all donuts from one variety.\n\n(c) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then this is the same as the number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties without any restrictions, which is a combination problem.

This can be done in C(8,3) + C(8,2) + C(8,1) + C(8,0) = 56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = 93 ways, where C(n, k) denotes the number of ways to choose k items from n.\n\n(c) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then the only restriction is that we can't choose all the donuts from the same variety. So, the total number of ways is 8^6 (each of the 6 donuts can be any of the 8 varieties) minus 8 (all 6 donuts are the same variety). That is, 8^6 - 8 = 262144 - 8 = 262136 ways.\n\n(d) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then each of the 6 donuts can be any of the 8 varieties, so there are 8^6 = 262144 ways to choose the donuts.\n\n(e) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, this problem can be solved by subtracting the cases where there are three, four, five, or six blueberry-filled donuts from the total number of ways with no restrictions. The total number of ways with no restrictions is 8^6 as calculated above. The number of cases where there are three, four, five, or six blueberry-filled donuts can be calculated as C(6,3)*7^3 + C(6,4)*7^2 + C(6,5)*7 + C(6,6) = 5600.

As you are choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties, this situation is not possible because you are trying to choose more donuts than the number of available varieties.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, you are essentially choosing one variety out of 8. This can be done in 8 ways.\n\n(c) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you have 3 fixed donuts and need to choose the remaining 3 from the 8 varieties (including the blueberry-filled variety). This can be done in C(8,3) ways, where C(n,r) represents the number of combinations of n items taken r at a time.

The rest of the donuts can be any variety (including blueberry). So, the total number of ways will be the sum of combinations when we have 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts. This will be C(8,6) + 8*C(7,5) + C(8,2)*C(7,4) = 28 + 8*21 + 28*35 = 1148 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, it means that we are choosing 6 donuts of 1 variety out of 8. So, there are 8 ways to do this (one for each variety).\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, it means that we can't have all 6 donuts of the same variety. So, the total number of ways will be the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties minus the ways when all donuts are of the same variety. This will be C(8+6-1,6) - 8 = 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, it means that we can have 3, 4, 5 or 6 blueberry-filled donuts. The rest of the donuts can be any variety. So, the total number of ways will be the sum of combinations when we have 3, 4, 5 or 6 blueberry donuts. This will be C(8,3)*C(7,3) + C(8,4)*C(7,2) + C(8,5)*C(7,1) + C(8,6) = 35*35 + 70*21 + 56*7 + 28 = 4136 ways.", "1#6#2#5#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, it means each donut must be of a different variety. However, this is not possible because you are choosing 6 donuts from only 8 varieties, implying there would be some repetitions. \n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, it means you are choosing one variety out of the 8. This can be done in 8 ways, because there are 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we are dealing with the problem of combinations with repetition. This can be solved using the formula for combinations with repetition, which is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts.

This is the same as choosing 6 donuts from 7 varieties, which is (7 + 6 - 1) choose 6 = 792 ways.\n- Case 2: One blueberry-filled donut. This is the same as choosing 5 donuts from 7 varieties, which is (7 + 5 - 1) choose 5 = 792 ways, but we multiply this by 6 because the blueberry-filled donut can be in any of the 6 positions in the bag. So, 792 * 6 = 4752 ways.\n- Case 3: Two blueberry-filled donuts. This is the same as choosing 4 donuts from 7 varieties, which is (7 + 4 - 1) choose 4 = 330 ways, but we multiply this by 15 (the number of ways to choose 2 positions from 6) because the blueberry-filled donuts can be in any of the 2 positions in the bag. So, 330 * 15 = 4950 ways.\nAdding up these cases, we get 792 + 4752 + 4950 = 10494 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have a few cases to consider:\n\n- Case 1: Three blueberry-filled donuts. This is the same as choosing 3 donuts from 7 varieties, which is (7 + 3 - 1) choose 3 = 84 ways, but we multiply this by 20 (the number of ways to choose 3 positions from 6) because the blueberry-filled donuts can be in any of the 3 positions in the bag. So, 84 * 20 = 1680 ways.\n- Case 2: Four blueberry-filled donuts. This is the same as choosing 2 donuts from 7 varieties, which is (7 + 2 - 1) choose 2 = 28 ways, but we multiply this by 15 because the blueberry-filled donuts can be in any of the 4 positions in the bag. So, 28 * 15 = 420 ways.\n- Case 3: Five blueberry-filled donuts. This is the same as choosing 1 donut from 7 varieties, which is (7 + 1 - 1) choose 1 = 7 ways, but we multiply this by 6 because the blueberry-filled donut can be in any of the 5 positions in the bag.

This would involve subtracting the 8 'single variety' options from the total number of combinations of 6 donuts from 8 varieties. The total number of combinations can be found using the formula for combinations with repetition, also known as multiset coefficients or \"combinations with replacement\", which is C(n+r-1,r) where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts.

Therefore, the number of ways is C(8+6-1, 6-1) = C(13,5) = 1287.\n\n(d) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider two cases: one blueberry donut and two blueberry donuts.\n\n    If there is one blueberry donut, then we need to choose 5 more donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. This can be done in C(7+5-1, 5-1) = C(11,4) = 330 ways.\n    \n    If there are two blueberry donuts, then we need to choose 4 more donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. This can be done in C(7+4-1, 4-1) = C(10,3) = 120 ways.\n    \n    Therefore, the total number of ways is 330 + 120 = 450.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider three cases: three blueberry donuts, four blueberry donuts, and five blueberry donuts.\n\n    If there are three blueberry donuts, then we need to choose 3 more donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. This can be done in C(7+3-1, 3-1) = C(9,2) = 36 ways.\n    \n    If there are four blueberry donuts, then we need to choose 2 more donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. This can be done in C(7+2-1, 2-1) = C(8,1) = 8 ways.\n    \n    If there are five blueberry donuts, then we need to choose 1 more donut from the remaining 7 varieties. This can be done in C(7+1-1, 1-1) = C(7,0) = 1 way.\n    \n    Therefore, the total number of ways is 36 + 8 + 1 = 45.", "1#6#5#2#4#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, it means that each donut is of a different type. However, since you want to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties, this scenario is not possible.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, it means that you can have 0, 1 or 2 blueberry donuts. The number of ways can be calculated as follows:\n- 0 blueberry donuts: choose 6 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7,6) = 7.\n- 1 blueberry donut: choose 1 blueberry donut and 5 from the remaining 7, which is C(7,5) = 21.\n- 2 blueberry donuts: choose 2 blueberry donuts and 4 from the remaining 7, which is C(7,4) = 35.\nAdd these up to get 7 + 21 + 35 = 63 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, it means you can have 3, 4, 5 or 6 blueberry donuts.\n- 3 blueberry donuts: choose 3 more from the remaining 7, which is C(7,3) = 35.\n- 4 blueberry donuts: choose 2 more from the remaining 7, which is C(7,2) = 21.\n- 5 blueberry donuts: choose 1 more from the remaining 7, which is C(7,1) = 7.\n- 6 blueberry donuts: no more choices needed, which is C(7,0) = 1.\nAdd these up to get 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways, corresponding to each of the 8 varieties.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is the total possibilities minus the case when all the donuts are of the same variety. The total possibilities are 8^6 (each of the 6 donuts can be of any of the 8 varieties). So the answer is 8^6 - 8 = 262,136. \n\nPlease note that the formula C(n, k) is used to calculate the number of ways to choose k items from n items.", "1#6#5#3#2#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it is not possible to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties because each variety can only be chosen once.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we have several cases:\n\n   - No blueberry donuts: This is the number of ways to choose 6 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7,6) = 7.\n   - One blueberry donut: This is the number of ways to choose 5 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7,5) = 21.\n   - Two blueberry donuts: This is the number of ways to choose 4 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7,4) = 35.\n   \n   Adding these up gives 7 + 21 + 35 = 63 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have the following cases:\n\n   - Three blueberry donuts: This is the number of ways to choose 3 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7,3) = 35.\n   - Four blueberry donuts: This is the number of ways to choose 2 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7,2) = 21.\n   - Five blueberry donuts: This is the number of ways to choose 1 donut from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7,1) = 7.\n   - Six blueberry donuts: This is only one way, when all donuts are blueberry.\n\n   Adding these up gives 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then each of the 6 donuts can be any of the 8 varieties. This is an example of combinations with repetition, which is given by the formula C(n+r-1,r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. Thus there are C(8+6-1,6) = C(13,6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose the variety, one for each variety.", "1#6#5#3#4#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then the maximum number of donuts you can choose is the number of varieties available, which is 8. But since you only want 6 donuts, it's not possible to select 6 donuts from 8 varieties without having at least one variety repeated.\n\n(b) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, there are a few scenarios to consider. First, you could have 0, 1, or 2 blueberry-filled donuts in the bag. For each of these scenarios, you would then choose the remaining donuts from the 7 other varieties. This would look like:\n    - 0 blueberry-filled: C(7, 6) = 7 ways\n    - 1 blueberry-filled: C(7, 5) = 21 ways\n    - 2 blueberry-filled: C(7, 4) = 35 ways\n    So there are 7 + 21 + 35 = 63 different ways to choose the donuts with this restriction.\n\n(c) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then you would have 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts. For each of these scenarios, you would then choose the remaining donuts from the 7 other varieties. This would look like:\n    - 3 blueberry-filled: C(7, 3) = 35 ways\n    - 4 blueberry-filled: C(7, 2) = 21 ways\n    - 5 blueberry-filled: C(7, 1) = 7 ways\n    - 6 blueberry-filled: C(7, 0) = 1 way\n    So there are 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64 different ways to choose the donuts with this restriction.\n\n(d) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then you're simply choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties with repetition. This is a combinations with repetitions problem, solved using the formula C(n+r-1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So the number of ways would be C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then the only scenario we need to subtract from the total (from part d) is the case where all 6 donuts are of the same variety. There are 8 such cases (one for each variety), so the total number of ways is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways. \n\nPlease note that there might be an error in your ordering of the questions. I've answered them in the order (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) as per the usual alphabetical order.", "1#6#5#4#2#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety:\nThis is not possible. We need to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties without any duplication, but we can't do this because we need more donuts than we have varieties.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety:\nThere are 8 ways to do this because we have 8 varieties and we just need to choose one variety for the bag of 6 donuts. \n\n(c) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag:\nThis situation is a bit more complex. We can break it down into three cases: no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, and two blueberry donuts.\n\n- No blueberry donuts: We have 7 varieties left, and we need to choose 6. The number of combinations is C(7, 6) = 7.\n\n- One blueberry donut: We have 7 varieties left, and we need to choose 5. The number of combinations is C(7, 5) = 21.\n\n- Two blueberry donuts: We have 7 varieties left, and we need to choose 4.

The number of combinations is C(7, 3) = 35.\n\n- Four blueberry donuts: We have 7 varieties left, and we need to choose 2. The number of combinations is C(7, 2) = 21.\n\n- Five blueberry donuts: We have 7 varieties left, and we need to choose 1. The number of combinations is C(7, 1) = 7.\n\n- Six blueberry donuts: There's only one way to do this, which is to choose all 6 donuts as blueberry.\n\nSo the total number of ways is 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64.", "1#6#5#4#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, it means each donut must be of a different variety.

The number of ways to choose in each case can be calculated using the combination formula nCr = n! / [(n-r)! r!], where n is the total number of varieties and r is the number of donuts chosen. Sum up the results from the three scenarios to get the total number of ways.\n\n(c) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you have four scenarios: three blueberry donuts, four blueberry donuts, five blueberry donuts, and six blueberry donuts. Use the combination formula again to calculate the number of ways to choose in each case, and sum up the results.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is essentially the opposite of choosing all 6 donuts from the same variety. Calculate the number of ways to choose all 6 donuts from the same variety (which is simply the number of varieties, 8, because you are choosing all 6 donuts from one variety), and subtract this from the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties with no restrictions.\n\n(e) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, use the combination formula with repetition allowed, which is (n+r-1)Cr = (n+r-1)! / [(n-1)! r!], where n is the total number of varieties and r is the number of donuts chosen.

Thus, we have C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then we are dealing with a combination without repetition. But as we are choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties, we can't satisfy this condition as we have to repeat at least one variety to make up to 6 donuts. So, no such combinations are possible.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we have 3 donuts fixed and we need to choose the remaining 3 donuts from 8 varieties (including the blueberry-filled). This is a combination with repetition, so the formula is C(n+r-1, r), with n = 8 and r = 3. Thus, we have C(8+3-1, 3) = C(10, 3) = 120 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the 8 ways when all donuts are of the same variety from the total unrestricted ways.

So in this case, it would be (8+6-1) choose 6, which equals 792.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is a bit more complicated. You would first calculate the total number of combinations (which we found to be 792 in part c) and then subtract the 8 ways in which all the donuts are of the same variety (which we found in part b).

Therefore, C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can break this down into three cases: 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts.

This is because there are 8 different varieties to choose from, and you're choosing all of one variety.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then you're looking at a combination with repetition. The formula for this is (n+r-1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6). This gives you (8+6-1) choose 6, or 13 choose 6, which equals 1716 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then you have to consider all possible combinations without any blueberry-filled donuts, with one blueberry-filled donut, and with two blueberry-filled donuts.

The total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties (no restrictions) is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!], where n is the total number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts chosen (6).

First, we pick 3 blueberry donuts, then we have 3 donuts left to choose from the remaining 8 varieties (including the possibility of more blueberry donuts).

The total ways to select 6 from 8 with repetition is given by the formula for combinations with repetition: C(n+r-1, r) where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6). This gives C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways. So, subtracting the 8 ways with only one variety, we get 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it means each donut in the bag must be a different variety. Because there are only 6 donuts in the bag, and there are 8 varieties to choose from, this is a simple combination problem. The number of ways to choose 6 different varieties out of 8 is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n - r)!], where n is the number of total items, and r is the number of items to choose.

You can simply choose any of the 8 varieties and take 6 donuts from it.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this becomes a problem of combination with repetition. The formula for this is (n+r-1)C(r) where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts.

However, this is impossible because we are choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties. So, you can't select 6 different varieties without repeating at least one. Therefore, there are 0 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, it means we are choosing 1 variety out of the 8 available. Therefore, there are 8 ways to do this.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, it means we can't choose 6 donuts of the same kind. We subtract the 8 ways of choosing all donuts of the same kind from the total ways of selecting 6 donuts from 8 varieties. The total ways can be calculated using the formula for combinations with repetition, which is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. Here, n = 8 and r = 6. So, (8 + 6 - 1) choose 6 = 13 choose 6 = 1716.

We do similar calculations for 1 and 2 blueberry donuts and add the results.", "2#4#1#6#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this is impossible because you can't have 6 different donuts out of only 8 varieties.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to do this because there are 8 varieties to choose from and you're choosing all donuts from one of those varieties.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this problem becomes a bit complicated. This would be the total number of ways minus the ways in which all donuts are the same variety. The total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties is 8^6 (since for each of the 6 donuts you choose, there are 8 options). The number of ways in which all donuts are the same variety is 8 (as calculated in part (b)). So, the total number of ways to choose the donuts such that there are at least two varieties is 8^6 - 8.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, this would be the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties (8^6) minus the ways in which there are more than two blueberry-filled donuts.

So, it would be 8^6 - 8.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, there are 8^6 = 262,144 ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties because we can choose any variety for each of the 6 donuts.\n\n(f) This situation requires a more complex calculation. We need to calculate the number of ways to choose 6 donuts with no more than 2 blueberry-filled donuts. This would include combinations with 0, 1, or 2 blueberry-filled donuts. \n\nFor 0 blueberry-filled donuts, we have 7^6 ways to fill the bag with the other varieties. For 1 blueberry-filled, we have 6 different spots the blueberry-filled donut could be, multiplied by the ways to fill the remaining 5 spots with the 7 other varieties (6 * 7^5). For 2 blueberry-filled donuts, we have 15 combinations of spots for them (6 choose 2), multiplied by the ways to fill the remaining 4 spots with the 7 other varieties (15 * 7^4). Adding these together gives the total number of ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, we would use the combination formula \"8 choose 6\" which equals 28 ways. This is because we are choosing 6 unique varieties from 8, without repetition.", "2#4#3#6#5#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then we are essentially choosing 1 variety from the 8 available. This is 8 choose 1, which is simply 8 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then you could have 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 varieties, each in different amounts. This is a more complex problem. Let's break it down:\n\n- Two varieties: You could have 5 and 1, 4 and 2, or 3 and 3 donuts of each variety. There are 8 choose 2 = 28 ways to pick the varieties, and 3 ways to distribute the donuts, for a total of 28*3 = 84 ways.\n- Three varieties: You could have 4,1,1 or 3,2,1 or 2,2,2. There are 8 choose 3 = 56 ways to pick the varieties, and 3 ways to distribute the donuts, for a total of 56*3 = 168 ways.\n- Four varieties: You could have 3,1,1,1 or 2,2,1,1. There are 8 choose 4 = 70 ways to pick the varieties, and 2 ways to distribute the donuts, for a total of 70*2 = 140 ways.\n- Five varieties: You could have 2,1,1,1,1. There are 8 choose 5 = 56 ways to pick the varieties, and 1 way to distribute the donuts, for a total of 56 ways.\n- Six varieties: You can't have six varieties because then you would have more than 6 donuts.\n\nIn total, there are 84+168+140+56 = 448 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then this is a problem of combinations with repetition, which can be solved using the formula (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So it would be (8 + 6 - 1) choose 6 = 13 choose 6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we have to consider different cases:\n\n- No blueberry-filled donuts: This is just like case (c), but with only 7 varieties, so it's (7 + 6 - 1) choose 6 = 792 ways.\n- One blueberry-filled donut: Choose 5 from 7, which is (7 + 5 - 1) choose 5 = 792 ways.\n- Two blueberry-filled donuts: Choose 4 from 7, which is (7 + 4 - 1) choose 4 = 330 ways.\n\nSo in total, there are 792+792+330 = 1914 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we have to consider different cases:\n\n- Three blueberry-filled donuts: Choose 3 from 7, which is (7 + 3 - 1) choose 3 = 84 ways.\n- Four blueberry-filled donuts: Choose 2 from 7, which is (7 + 2 - 1) choose 2 = 36 ways.\n- Five blueberry-filled donuts: Choose 1 from 7, which is (7 + 1 - 1) choose 1 = 7 ways.\n- Six blueberry-filled donuts: All donuts are blueberry-filled, which is 1 way.\n\nSo in total, there are 84+36+7+1 = 128 ways", "2#4#5#1#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, we can choose a donut from 8 different varieties, then another from the remaining 7, then another from the remaining 6, and so on until we have 6 donuts.

This is calculated as C(n+r-1, r) = C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1,716.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the 8 ways in which all donuts are of the same variety (from part b) from the total number of unrestricted possibilities (from part c).

This is calculated as C(n+r-1, r) = C(8+3-1, 3) = C(10, 3) = 120. But, we also need to add the cases where there are 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts in the bag. These are C(8+2-1,2) = C(9,2) = 36, C(8+1-1,1) = C(8,1) = 8, and C(8+0-1,0) = C(7,0) = 1 respectively.

The total number of ways to pick 6 donuts from 8 varieties with replacement is 8^6. The number of ways to pick 6 donuts from 8 varieties of the same variety is 8. So the number of ways is 8^6 - 8.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we must first choose 3 donuts of the blueberry variety.

The number of ways to choose 6 different donuts from 8 varieties is 8 choose 6, which is 28.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can calculate this by subtracting the ways in which there are more than two blueberry-filled donuts from the total ways. The total ways is 8^6. The ways in which there are more than two blueberry-filled donuts is 8^6 - 7^6 (removing the cases where there are 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts).

There are 8 different varieties of donuts and we are choosing 6, so the number of ways to do this is 8 choose 6, which equals 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then we are simply choosing one variety out of the 8 available. This is 8 choose 1, which equals 8 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then each of the 6 donuts can be any of the 8 varieties.

This can be solved using the formula (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So, in this case, it would be (8 + 6 - 1) choose 6 = 13 choose 6 = 1716.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we should subtract the number of ways with only one variety from the total number of ways.

The total number of ways without restrictions can be calculated using a combination with repetition. The formula is C(n+r-1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts.

The total ways of choosing without restriction is 8^6 = 262144. The ways of having only one variety is 8 (from part b).

The total count of possible bags with no restrictions is calculated using a combination with repetition, which is (n+k-1) choose k, where n is the number of varieties and k is the number of donuts.

For each case, you have to choose the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties. So, the total number of ways is:\nC(7,0)*C(7,3) + C(7,1)*C(7,2) + C(7,2)*C(7,1) + C(7,3)*C(7,0) = 35 + 735 + 735 + 35 = 1540, where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, you can think of it as the total ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties minus the ways to choose all 6 donuts of the same variety (which is part b).

This is equivalent to choosing 6 items (donuts) from 8 categories (varieties), and the formula is C(n+r-1,r), where n is the number of categories and r is the number of items.

So, C(8, 6) = 8! / [(8-6)!6!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then we are simply choosing one variety out of the 8 available. This corresponds to 8 choose 1, or C(8,1), which is 8 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, the number of ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties is given by the combination with repetition formula C(n + r - 1, r) = (n + r - 1)! / [(n - 1)!r!].

This equals 28.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then the number of ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties is just 8, because we simply choose one of the 8 varieties to fill the entire bag.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then we are dealing with a problem of combinations with repetition, which is calculated as (n + r - 1)C(r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts.

So the number of ways is 247 - 8 = 239.", "2#6#3#1#4#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it's not possible to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties, because you would only be able to choose a maximum of 8 donuts, one from each variety.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose the bag, because there are 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then it becomes a problem of combinations with repetitions allowed. The formula for such combinations is (n+r-1) C r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts to choose. Therefore, there are (8+6-1) C 6 = 13 C 6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we have to subtract the number of ways to choose a bag with only one variety from the total. We have 8 ways to choose a bag with only one variety, and we found 1716 ways to choose a bag with no restrictions. So, there are 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways to choose a bag with at least two varieties.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to subtract the ways in which there are three or more blueberry-filled donuts from the total.\n\nThere are 6 ways to choose 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts. For each of these ways, there are (8-1+6-n) C (6-n) ways to choose the remaining donuts, where n is the number of blueberry-filled donuts.\n\nSo, subtracting these from the total, we get 1716 - [6 C 3 * 7 C 3 + 6 C 4 * 7 C 2 + 6 C 5 * 7 C 1 + 6 C 6 * 7 C 0] = 1716 - [35*35 + 15*21 + 6*7 + 1] = 1716 - [1225 + 315 + 42 + 1] = 1716 - 1583 = 133 ways.", "2#6#3#1#5#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose, one for each variety.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you would have to consider multiple cases. The cases are 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts. For each case, you are choosing the rest of the donuts from 7 other varieties. The total number of ways would be the sum of these cases:\n\n- 0 blueberry donuts: Choose 6 from the other 7 varieties, which is C(7,6) = 7.\n- 1 blueberry donut: Choose 5 from the other 7 varieties, which is C(7,5) = 21.\n- 2 blueberry donuts: Choose 4 from the other 7 varieties, which is C(7,4) = 35.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways would be 7 + 21 + 35 = 63.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, you are simply choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties. Since the order doesn't matter and replacement is allowed, you would use the combination with repetition formula: C(n + r - 1, r) = C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13,6) = 1716.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, you are choosing 6 unique varieties from 8, which is C(8,6) = 28.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you would consider cases where there are 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts. For each case, you are choosing the rest of the donuts from 7 other varieties. The total number of ways would be the sum of these cases:\n\n- 3 blueberry donuts: Choose 3 from the other 7 varieties, which is C(7,3) = 35.\n- 4 blueberry donuts: Choose 2 from the other 7 varieties, which is C(7,2) = 21.\n- 5 blueberry donuts: Choose 1 from the other 7 varieties, which is C(7,1) = 7.\n- 6 blueberry donuts: Choose 0 from the other 7 varieties, which is C(7,0) = 1.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways would be 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64.", "2#6#3#4#1#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose the donuts. This is because there are 8 varieties to choose from, and you're choosing all of the same variety.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, there are multiple ways to calculate this. One way is to calculate the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts without restriction, and then subtract the cases where there are more than two blueberry-filled donuts. The total number of ways without restriction is given by a binomial coefficient: C(8,6) * 6^6, because you're choosing 6 out of 8 varieties, and for each choice, there are 6 options (since you can have up to 6 of each variety). To find the cases with more than two blueberry-filled donuts, you would calculate the number of ways to choose 6 donuts where 3 or more are blueberry-filled, and subtract that from the total. This requires a more complex calculation and may involve calculating multiple binomial coefficients and summing them.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then you are simply choosing 6 donuts out of 8 varieties with repetition allowed. This is a combination with repetition problem, often solved by the \"stars and bars\" method. The formula is C(n+r-1, r) where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So, C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, you would calculate the total number of ways with no restrictions (as in part c) and then subtract the cases where all the donuts are of the same variety (as in part b). So, 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then you are simply choosing 6 different varieties out of 8, with no repetition. This is a basic combination problem, given by the binomial coefficient C(8,6) = 28 ways.", "2#6#3#4#5#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose a bag. This is because each variety represents a different way to fill the bag.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, it's a bit more complicated. First, consider the case where there are two blueberry donuts. The remaining 4 donuts can be chosen from the remaining 7 varieties. This can be done in C(4+7-1, 4) = 210 ways, where C(n, k) is a binomial coefficient or \"combinations\" function. Now consider the case where there is one blueberry donut. The remaining 5 can be chosen from 7 varieties in C(5+7-1, 5) = 792 ways. Finally, if there are no blueberry donuts, the 6 can be chosen from 7 varieties in C(6+7-1, 6) = 792 ways. So, the total number of ways is 210 + 792 + 792 = 1794 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then each of the 6 donuts can be any of the 8 varieties. This is equivalent to an \"ordered sample with replacement\" in statistics, and the total number of ways is 8^6 = 262,144 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is the total number of unrestricted cases minus the cases where all donuts are the same. So, the answer is 262,144 - 8 = 262,136 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, consider the cases where there are exactly 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts. The remaining donuts can be any of the other 7 varieties. This gives C(3+7-1, 3) + C(2+7-1, 2) + C(1+7-1, 1) + C(0+7-1, 0) = 84 + 21 + 6 + 1 = 112 ways.", "2#6#3#5#1#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose the donuts, as there are 8 varieties.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider a few cases. One case is when we don't choose any blueberry donuts, another case is when we choose one blueberry donut, and the last case is when we choose two blueberry donuts. \n\nWhen we don't choose any blueberry donuts, we have 7 varieties left and we need to choose 6 donuts. This results in (7+6-1) choose 6 = 792 ways. \n\nWhen we choose one blueberry donut, we have 7 varieties left and we need to choose 5 donuts. This results in (7+5-1) choose 5 = 792 ways. \n\nWhen we choose two blueberry donuts, we have 7 varieties left and we need to choose 4 donuts. This results in (7+4-1) choose 4 = 210 ways. \n\nSo in total, there are 792+792+210 = 1794 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we can choose any of the 8 varieties of donuts. This results in (8+6-1) choose 6 = 5005 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider two cases. One case is when we choose three blueberry donuts, and another case is when we choose four blueberry donuts (since we can't have more than six donuts in the bag).\n\nWhen we choose three blueberry donuts, we have 7 varieties left and we need to choose 3 donuts. This results in (7+3-1) choose 3 = 120 ways. \n\nWhen we choose four blueberry donuts, we have 7 varieties left and we need to choose 2 donuts. This results in (7+2-1) choose 2 = 36 ways. \n\nSo in total, there are 120+36 = 156 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, we can choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties without repetition.

The number of ways to choose the bag of 6 donuts is the sum of:\n\n    - The number of ways to choose 6 donuts with none being blueberry-filled: 7 varieties remaining, with each bag containing 6 donuts, is calculated as C(7,6)*1=7\n    - The number of ways to choose 6 donuts with one being blueberry-filled: 1 blueberry-filled and 5 from the remaining 7 varieties, calculated as C(7,5)*1=21\n    - The number of ways to choose 6 donuts with two being blueberry-filled: 2 blueberry-filled and 4 from the remaining 7 varieties, calculated as C(7,4)*1=35\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways is 7 + 21 + 35 = 63 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, you can choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties. This is a problem of combinations with repetition, calculated as C(n+k-1,k), where n is the number of varieties (8) and k is the number of donuts (6). Thus, C(8+6-1,6) = C(13,6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, the bag can contain 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts. This is similar to (f), and the total number of ways is calculated as the sum of:\n\n    - 3 blueberry-filled and 3 from the remaining 7 varieties: C(7,3)*1=35\n    - 4 blueberry-filled and 2 from the remaining 7 varieties: C(7,2)*1=21\n    - 5 blueberry-filled and 1 from the remaining 7 varieties: C(7,1)*1=7\n    - 6 blueberry-filled and 0 from the remaining 7 varieties: C(7,0)*1=1\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways is 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is equivalent to the total number of ways without restrictions (1716 from (c)) minus the number of ways where all donuts are of the same variety (8 from (b)). Therefore, the total number of ways is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.", "2#6#4#1#3#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts. This is because there are 8 different varieties to choose from.\n\n(f) To calculate the number of ways to choose a bag of donuts with no more than two blueberry-filled, first we need to calculate the total ways of choosing 6 donuts without any restrictions, and then subtract the ways of choosing 3 or more blueberry-filled donuts. The total ways without restrictions is C(8,6)*6! = 28*720 = 20160. Now, we consider the ways of choosing 3 or more blueberry-filled donuts. This is C(8,3)*3!*C(7,3)*3! = 56*6*35*6 = 70560. So, the total ways of choosing with no more than two blueberry-filled donuts is 20160 - 70560 = -50400. This doesn't make sense as the result can't be negative, so there seems to be a mistake in the calculation. We might need to revisit the problem's conditions or constraints.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we must subtract from the total number of ways the 8 ways in which all the donuts could be of the same variety.

This is because there are only 8 varieties, so we can't choose 6 different donuts without repeating a variety.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then we can simply choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties in any combination. This is a problem of combinations with repetition, which can be calculated using the formula C(n+r-1,r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts to choose.

This can be done in C(8,6) = 28 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then all possible combinations minus the 8 cases where all 6 are of the same variety would be C(8,6)*6^6 - 8 = 1,679,616 ways.", "2#6#5#3#1#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose, because there are 8 different varieties.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we need to consider several cases:\n- No blueberry donuts: There are 8 varieties to choose from for 6 donuts, which is 8C6=28 ways.\n- One blueberry donut: There are 7 remaining varieties to choose 5 donuts, which is 7C5=21 ways.\n- Two blueberry donuts: There are 7 remaining varieties to choose 4 donuts, which is 7C4=35 ways.\nAdding these up, there are 28+21+35=84 total ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we also need to consider several cases:\n- Three blueberry donuts: There are 7 remaining varieties to choose 3 donuts, which is 7C3=35 ways.\n- Four blueberry donuts: There are 7 remaining varieties to choose 2 donuts, which is 7C2=21 ways.\n- Five blueberry donuts: There are 7 remaining varieties to choose 1 donut, which is 7C1=7 ways.\n- Six blueberry donuts: This is just one way.\nAdding these up, there are 35+21+7+1=64 total ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we can use the stars and bars method, which gives us (n+k-1)C(k-1) where n is the number of varieties and k is the number of donuts.

The case where there are no blueberry donuts, the case where there is 1 blueberry donut, and the case where there are 2 blueberry donuts. For each case, the remaining donuts can be of any variety. This involves some complex combinatorics and would be easier to calculate with a formula. \n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you would have to consider the cases where there are 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts.

Therefore, there are 8 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have several scenarios. No blueberry, one blueberry, or two blueberries. For each of these scenarios, the rest of the bag can be filled in any combination from the remaining 7 varieties. This is a complex problem, but the solution would be: 7^6 (no blueberry) + 7^5 * 6 (one blueberry in 6 positions) + 7^4 * 15 (two blueberries in 15 positions).

This is a combination with replacement problem, and can be calculated using the formula C(n+r-1, r) where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts.

This is a simple combination problem, so the answer is 8 choose 6 = 28 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts, we have 3 situations: exactly 3, 4, or 5 blueberry-filled donuts. We treat blueberry-filled donuts as one variety and the rest as another, then use the formula for combinations with repetition.\n\n- If there are exactly 3 blueberry-filled donuts, we have 3 spots left to fill with 7 other varieties, so it's (7+3-1) choose 3 = 84 ways.\n- If there are exactly 4 blueberry-filled donuts, we have 2 spots left to fill with 7 other varieties, so it's (7+2-1) choose 2 = 36 ways.\n- If there are exactly 5 blueberry-filled donuts, we have 1 spot left to fill with 7 other varieties, so it's (7+1-1) choose 1 = 7 ways.\n- If all 6 donuts are blueberry-filled, there is only 1 way.\nSumming all these, we get 84+36+7+1 = 128 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 possible varieties to choose from, so there are 8 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the number of ways with only one variety (from part (b)) from the total number of ways with no restrictions (from part (c)).

The formula for combinations with repetition is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts chosen. In this case, it would be (8 + 6 - 1) choose 6, which is 13 choose 6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then you can only choose 6 different donuts from 8 varieties. This is a simple combination problem with the formula n choose r. In this case, it is 8 choose 6 = 28 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have three cases: exactly 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts. Each case would be calculated as the number of ways to choose the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties. For example, if there are exactly 3 blueberry donuts, then we need to choose the other 3 from 7 varieties, which can be done in (7 + 3 - 1) choose 3 = 84 ways. The same would be done for 4, 5, and 6 blueberry donuts, and the results would be summed.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are only 8 ways to fill the bag, corresponding to the 8 varieties of donuts.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we would calculate the total number of ways to fill the bag (from part (c)) and subtract the cases where there are 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts (from part (e)).", "3#1#5#4#2#": "(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, it is a problem of choosing with repetition.

Since we are selecting 6 donuts from 8 varieties, this is just a combination without repetition and the number of ways is C(8,6) = 28 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have 3 scenarios. Exactly 3, 4, or 5 blueberry donuts. For each case, we fill the rest of the bag from the remaining 7 varieties. This is again a problem of combination with repetition.

So, there are 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we need to subtract the combinations with three or more blueberry-filled donuts from the total number of combinations.

We can only choose as many donuts as there are varieties. So, if this were a question for choosing 8 donuts from 8 varieties with no duplicates, it would be 8! = 40320. However, since the number of donuts we're choosing is less than the number of varieties available, the problem is not possible.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to choose the remaining 3 donuts from the 8 varieties (including the blueberry). So, we have C(8+3-1, 3) = C(10, 3) = 120 ways for 3 donuts, but since there are 3 blueberry-filled donuts already in the bag, the total number of ways is 120 * 1 = 120.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, it means we can have 0, 1, or 2 blueberry-filled donuts.

This is 8 choose 1 = 8 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we are essentially dealing with a problem of distributing 6 identical items (the donuts) into 8 distinct groups (the varieties). This is a combination with repetition problem, which is solved as (n+r-1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6).

This can be solved using the formula for combinations with replacement: C(n + r - 1, r) = (n + r - 1)! / [r!(n - 1)!]. Here, n = 8 (varieties of donuts) and r = 6 (donuts in the bag). So, the number of ways is C(8+6-1, 6) = 3003 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider three cases: 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts. For each case, the remaining donuts can be any variety, including blueberry.

This gives us: C(8,6) + C(8,5)*C(7+1-1,1) + C(8,4)*C(7+2-1,2) = 28 + 336 + 1050 = 1414 ways.", "3#2#1#6#4#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then you can only choose one donut from each variety. Since you need to fill a bag of 6 donuts and you have 8 varieties, the number of ways you can do this is the number of ways you can choose 6 varieties out of 8, which is a combination problem. The answer is C(8,6) = 28.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then you are basically choosing one variety out of 8 to fill your bag. This is a simple combination problem with only one item to choose, so the answer is C(8,1) = 8.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then the problem becomes a combination with repetition problem. The number of ways is given by the combination formula with repetition: C(n + r - 1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So the answer is C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13,6) = 1716.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can subtract the number of ways with only one variety (which we found in part b) from the total number of ways with no restrictions (which we found in part c).

No blueberry donut: This is similar to the unrestricted case, but with 7 varieties instead of 8. So the number of ways is C(7 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(12,6) = 924.\n2. One blueberry donut: We choose one blueberry donut and the rest from the other 7 varieties. So the number of ways is C(7 + 5 - 1, 5) = C(11,5) = 462.\n3. Two blueberry donuts: We choose two blueberry donuts and the rest from the other 7 varieties. So the number of ways is C(7 + 4 - 1, 4) = C(10,4) = 210.\nAdding up all these cases, the total number of ways is 924 + 462 + 210 = 1596.", "3#2#1#6#5#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this means we are choosing 6 different varieties from 8.

For zero blueberry, it is 7 choose 6 (7 varieties to choose from); for one blueberry, it is 7 choose 5 (1 is already a blueberry, 7 varieties left to choose from); for two blueberries, it is 7 choose 4 (2 are already blueberries, 7 varieties left to choose from).

For three blueberries, it is 7 choose 3 (3 are already blueberries, 7 varieties left to choose from); for four blueberries, it is 7 choose 2; for five blueberries, it is 7 choose 1; for six blueberries, it is 7 choose 0.

So, C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13,6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then we just have to choose one variety from the 8 available. So, there are 8 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we need to consider three cases: no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, two blueberry donuts. For each case, we then choose the rest from the remaining 7 varieties. That's C(12,6) for no blueberry, C(12,5) for one blueberry and C(12,4) for two blueberries.

So, the number of ways would be (8 choose 1) = 8 ways.", "3#5#1#6#4#": "(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of combinations with repetition. The formula for such problems is C(n + r - 1, r) where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6). So, there are C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we first choose 3 blueberry-filled donuts. Then we need to choose the remaining 3 donuts from the 8 varieties (including blueberry). This is again a problem of combinations with repetition. So, there are C(8 + 3 - 1, 3) = C(10, 3) = 120 ways. \n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this is a problem of combinations without repetition. The formula for such problems is C(n, r) where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6). So, there are C(8, 6) = 28 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider three cases: no blueberry-filled, one blueberry-filled, and two blueberry-filled. For each case, we calculate the number of ways to fill the rest of the bag. The total number of ways is the sum of the numbers of ways in each case. So, there are C(7 + 6 - 1, 6) + 7*C(7 + 5 - 1, 5) + C(7, 4)*7*6/2 = 792 + 1470 + 1050 = 3312 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can subtract the number of ways with only one variety from the total number of ways with no restrictions. So, there are 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.", "3#5#2#1#4#": "(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, you are choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties, with repetition allowed. This is a problem of combination with repetition, which is solved using the formula C(n+r-1,r) = C(n+r-1,n-1), where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6). So the number of ways is C(8+6-1,6) = C(13,6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you can consider this as three cases: exactly 3, 4, or all 5 blueberry donuts. For each case, you would calculate it as choosing the remaining donuts from the other varieties. \n\nFor 3 blueberry donuts, you're choosing 3 donuts from 7 other varieties, which is C(7+3-1,3) = C(9,3) = 84 ways. \nFor 4 blueberry donuts, you're choosing 2 donuts from 7 other varieties, which is C(7+2-1,2) = C(8,2) = 28 ways.\nFor 5 blueberry donuts, you're choosing 1 donut from 7 other varieties, which is C(7+1-1,1) = C(7,1) = 7 ways.\nAdding these up gives 84 + 28 + 7 = 119 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are simply 8 ways, one for each variety.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, you're choosing 6 distinct varieties from 8, which is a problem of combination without repetition. The number of ways is C(8,6) = 28 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is the total number of ways without restrictions minus the ways with only one variety. From part (c) we know there are 1716 total ways, and from part (b) we know there are 8 ways with only one variety, so there are 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.", "3#5#2#1#6#": "(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of combinations with repetition, which is solved by the formula C(n+r-1,r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts.

For each case, we calculate the number of ways to distribute the remaining donuts among the remaining varieties, and sum these up:\n\n- 3 blueberry: C(7+3-1,3) = C(9,3) = 84 ways\n- 4 blueberry: C(7+2-1,2) = C(8,2) = 28 ways\n- 5 blueberry: C(7+1-1,1) = C(7,1) = 7 ways\n- 6 blueberry: C(7+0-1,0) = C(6,0) = 1 way\n\nAdding these up, we get 84 + 28 + 7 + 1 = 120 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 varieties to choose from, so there are 8 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this is a problem of combinations without repetition, solved by the formula C(n,r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. Here, n = 8 and r = 6, so the number of ways is C(8,6) = 28 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have three cases to consider: 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts. For each case, we calculate the number of ways to distribute the remaining donuts among the remaining varieties, and sum these up:\n\n- 0 blueberry: C(7+6-1,6) = C(12,6) = 924 ways\n- 1 blueberry: C(7+5-1,5) = C(11,5) = 462 ways\n- 2 blueberry: C(7+4-1,4) = C(10,4) = 210 ways\n\nAdding these up, we get 924 + 462 + 210 = 1596 ways.", "3#5#2#4#1#": "(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, the problem can be solved by using a combination with repetition. This formula is (n+r-1)C(r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts to choose.

This gives us (8+3-1)C(3) = 10C3 = 120 ways. However, we also have to add the cases where there are 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts. This means we also have to calculate (8+2-1)C(2), (8+1-1)C(1), and (8+0-1)C(0), which are 36, 8, and 1, respectively.

There are 3 cases: choosing 3, 4, or 5 blueberry-filled donuts. Sum of these cases is: (8+3-1) choose 3 + (8+2-1) choose 2 + (8+1-1) choose 1 = 220 + 36 + 8 = 264 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose the variety, and only 1 way to choose 6 donuts from that variety, so there are 8 ways in total.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the number of ways with only one variety from the total number of ways with no restrictions. That is 3003 - 8 = 2995 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we add the number of ways to choose 0, 1 or 2 blueberry-filled donuts from the bag.

This gives us C(8+6-1, 6) + C(8+5-1, 5) + C(8+4-1, 4) = 1716 + 792 + 330 = 2838 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways. This is because there are 8 different varieties to choose from, and we choose one variety to fill the entire bag.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, we are dealing with a problem of combinations without repetition. This is given by the formula C(n, r), where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6). So the number of ways is C(8, 6) = 28 ways.\n", "3#5#6#2#4#": "(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, the problem becomes a multiset coefficient problem. The number of ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties is given by the multiset coefficient ((8+6-1) choose 6) = (13 choose 6) = 1716.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can think of this problem as first choosing 3 blueberry donuts and then choosing the remaining 3 donuts from 8 varieties (since we can still choose more blueberry donuts). This is given by ((8+3-1) choose 3) = (10 choose 3) = 120.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can think of this problem as the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts minus the number of ways to choose 6 donuts with at least 3 blueberry donuts. This is given by 1716 (from part c) - 120 (from part e) = 1596.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then this simply means choosing 1 variety from the 8, which is given by (8 choose 1) = 8.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can think of this problem as the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts minus the number of ways to choose 6 donuts of the same variety.

It can be solved using the formula (n+k-1 choose k) where n is the number of varieties (8) and k is the number of donuts (6). So, the total number of ways is (8+6-1 choose 6) = (13 choose 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(c) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag: First, we fix 3 blueberry donuts. Then we have to choose 3 more from the remaining 8 varieties. This can be done in (8+3-1 choose 3) = (10 choose 3) = 120 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag: We can consider the opposite case, i.e., all the donuts are of the same variety. There are 8 such ways (one for each variety). So, the total number of ways, without restrictions, is 1716 (as calculated in (b)). Therefore, the number of ways with at least two varieties is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag: This case can be divided into three subcases - 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts. \n\n   - 0 blueberry: We need to choose 6 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. This can be done in (7+6-1 choose 6) = (12 choose 6) = 924 ways.\n   \n   - 1 blueberry: We need to choose 5 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. This can be done in (7+5-1 choose 5) = (11 choose 5) = 462 ways.\n   \n   - 2 blueberry: We need to choose 4 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. This can be done in (7+4-1 choose 4) = (10 choose 4) = 210 ways.\n   \n   Adding all these, the total number of ways is 924 + 462 + 210 = 1596 ways.", "3#5#6#4#2#": "(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we are essentially drawing with replacement (we can choose the same variety more than once). This is a problem of combinations with repetition which can be solved using the formula C(n + r - 1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So, the number of ways is C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can divide this problem into three cases: exactly 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts. For each case, we calculate the number of ways to distribute the remaining donuts among the other 7 varieties. Sum these up to get the total.\n   - 3 blueberry: C(10,3) = 120\n   - 4 blueberry: C(9,2) = 36\n   - 5 blueberry: C(8,1) = 8\n   - 6 blueberry: C(7,0) = 1\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways is 120 + 36 + 8 + 1 = 165 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we consider 4 cases: 0, 1, 2 blueberry-filled donuts.

Total ways without any restriction we calculated in part (c) is 1716. The ways with more than two blueberry-filled donuts would be C(8+3-1, 3) = C(10, 3) = 120 ways. So, the number of ways would be 1716 - 120 = 1596 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this would be a combination without repetition problem. The formula for this is C(n, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts to be chosen.

Total ways without any restriction we calculated in part (c) is 1716. The ways with only one variety we calculated in part (b) is 8.

So the number of ways is C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716.\n\n(f) This situation is similar to (c), but we need to consider the restriction of no more than two blueberry-filled donuts. We can consider this in two cases: one with no blueberry-filled donuts, and one with two blueberry-filled donuts. The sum of these two cases gives the total number of ways. Case 1: 0 blueberry-filled donuts, C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716. Case 2: 2 blueberry-filled donuts, C(8+4-1, 4) = C(11, 4) = 330.

The formula is C(n, r), so the number of ways is C(8, 6) = 28.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are as many ways as there are varieties, because we can only choose one variety for all the donuts.

Case 1: 3 blueberry-filled donuts, C(7+3-1, 3) = C(9, 3) = 84. Case 2: all 6 blueberry-filled donuts, which is only 1 way.

The number of ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties is given by the formula for combinations with repetition, which is (n+k-1 choose k), where n is the number of varieties and k is the number of donuts. So the number of ways is (8+6-1 choose 6) = (13 choose 6) = 1716.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider the cases where there are 0, 1, and 2 blueberry donuts separately. If there are 0 blueberry donuts, the problem is equivalent to choosing 6 donuts from 7 varieties, which is (7+6-1 choose 6) = (12 choose 6) = 924. If there is 1 blueberry donut, the problem is equivalent to choosing 5 donuts from 7 varieties, which is (7+5-1 choose 5) = (11 choose 5) = 462. If there are 2 blueberry donuts, the problem is equivalent to choosing 4 donuts from 7 varieties, which is (7+4-1 choose 4) = (10 choose 4) = 210.

The number of ways where all donuts are of the same variety is simply the number of varieties, which is 8.

For each case, calculate the number of ways to fill the remaining slots with the other 7 varieties of donuts. \n\n- 0 blueberry-filled: (7+6-1) choose 6 = \"12 choose 6\" = 924 ways\n- 1 blueberry-filled: (7+5-1) choose 5 = \"11 choose 5\" = 462 ways\n- 2 blueberry-filled: (7+4-1) choose 4 = \"10 choose 4\" = 210 ways\nAdding these up, you get 924 + 462 + 210 = 1596 ways.", "4#1#6#2#5#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, it means each donut is of a different variety. However, this isn't possible as we need to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties. We can only choose a maximum of 1 donut from each variety, which would give us only 8 donuts, not 6.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to do this because there are 8 varieties of donuts to choose from.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we would use combinations with repetition. The formula is (n + r - 1) C (r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. Therefore, we get (8 + 6 - 1) C (6) = 13 C 6 = 1716. However, this includes the option of having all 6 donuts of the same variety, which is not allowed. So we subtract the 8 ways of having all donuts of the same variety, giving us 1708 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have different cases to consider. We could have no blueberry-filled donuts, one blueberry-filled donut, or two blueberry-filled donuts. We then choose the rest of the donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. Summing up the combinations for these cases, we get (7 + 6 - 1) C (6) + 7 * (7 + 5 - 1) C (5) + 7 * 7 * (7 + 4 - 1) C (4) = 792 + 2520 + 3500 = 6812 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, again we have different cases to consider. We could have three, four, five, or six blueberry-filled donuts. We then choose the rest of the donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. Summing up the combinations for these cases, we get 7 * 7 * (7 + 3 - 1) C (3) + 7 * (7 + 2 - 1) C (2) + (7 + 1 - 1) C (1) + 1 = 2100 + 420 + 7 + 1 = 2528 ways.", "4#1#6#3#2#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then we can only choose one donut from each variety. Since the bag can contain only 6 donuts, the number of ways we can do this is the number of ways we can choose 6 varieties from 8, which is given by the combination formula: C(8,6) = 8! / [(8-6)!6!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then we are essentially choosing 1 variety out of 8 to fill the bag with. This can be done in 8 ways (one for each variety).\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we are dealing with a problem of combinations with repetition. The formula for this is C(n + r - 1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. Here, n=8 and r=6, so the number of combinations is C(8+6-1,6) = C(13,6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the number of single-variety bags from the total number of unrestricted bags. There are 8 single-variety bags (from part b), so the number of at-least-two-variety bags is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we need to consider three scenarios: no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, and two blueberry donuts. \n\n- No blueberry donuts: we are choosing 6 donuts from 7 varieties. This can be done in C(7+6-1,6) = C(12,6) = 924 ways.\n\n- One blueberry donut: we are choosing 5 donuts from 7 varieties. This can be done in C(7+5-1,5) = C(11,5) = 462 ways.\n\n- Two blueberry donuts: we are choosing 4 donuts from 7 varieties.

We can't just choose 6 of one variety, so we have to consider combinations. If we choose 2 varieties, each with 3 donuts, there are 8 choose 2 = 28 ways. If we choose 3 varieties, each with 2 donuts, there are 8 choose 3 = 56 ways.

We can solve this using the stars and bars method, but we must subtract the cases where all the donuts are of one variety. So, the total number of ways is (6+8-1 choose 8-1) - 8 = (13 choose 7) - 8 = 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, it means we are choosing 6 unique varieties from 8, which is a combination problem. The number of ways is given by 8 choose 6 = 28 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have three sub-cases: 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts.

If there is 1, this is the same as choosing 1 from 1 variety and 5 from 7 varieties, so 7^5 = 16807 ways. If there are 2, this is the same as choosing 2 from 1 variety and 4 from 7 varieties, so 7^4 = 2401 ways. Adding these up, there are 117649 + 16807 + 2401 = 135857 ways.", "4#2#3#6#5#": "(a) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety:\n\nThere are 8 varieties of donuts and you are choosing 6 of the same kind.

Therefore, the number of ways is C(8, 6) = 8! / [6!(8-6)!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) if all donuts in the bag are of the same variety?\n- Since all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, we are essentially choosing 1 variety from 8. Thus, there are C(8, 1) = 8 ways.\n\n(c) if there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag?\n- If there are no restrictions, we can view this as an application of the stars and bars concept, where we have 8 types of donuts (the bars) and 6 identical donuts (the stars). The number of ways to distribute the donuts is equivalent to choosing 6 donuts from the 8 varieties, plus duplicates. This is equivalent to C(6+8-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 13! / [6!(13-6)!] = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) if there must be at least two varieties in the bag?\n- We can find this by subtracting the number of ways where all the donuts are of the same variety from the total number of ways without restrictions.

This is simply 8 choose 1, so the answer is C(8,1) = 8 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then each donut can be of any of the 8 varieties. This is a problem of distributing 6 indistinguishable objects (donuts) into 8 distinguishable boxes (varieties), with the possibility of some boxes being empty. This is solved by the stars and bars method, so the answer is C(6+8-1, 6) = C(13,6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we subtract the cases where all donuts are of the same variety (which we calculated in (b) as 8) from the total number of ways with no restrictions (which we calculated in (c) as 1716).

If the only restriction is on the number of blueberry donuts, and there are no other restrictions, one possible interpretation could lead to a total of 1616 ways to choose the donuts (but this could vary based on the specific interpretation of the problem).", "4#3#1#5#2#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety:\nThis is not possible since you are trying to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties without repeating, which would mean you would only have a total of 8 donuts to choose from, not 6.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety:\nThis is simply the number of varieties, which is 8. Any of the 8 varieties could fill the bag entirely.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag:\nThis is a problem of combinations with repetition, which is calculated by the formula (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. In this case, it's (8 + 6 - 1) choose 6 = 13 choose 6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag:\nThis is the total number of combinations minus the cases where all donuts are of the same variety. So, 1716 (from part c) - 8 (from part b) = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag:\nFirst, choose 3 blueberry-filled donuts. Then, choose the remaining 3 donuts from the 8 varieties (including blueberry). Using the formula (n + r - 1) choose r, it's (8 + 3 - 1) choose 3 = 10 choose 3 = 120 ways.", "4#3#1#5#6#": "(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag:\nThis question is a bit tricky because it doesn't specify whether there can be multiple donuts of the same variety or not. Assuming that there can be multiple donuts of the same variety, it's easier to calculate the total number of combinations without restrictions and then subtract the number of combinations with only one variety (which is unwanted). The total number of combinations without restrictions is given by the stars and bars formula (8+6-1) choose 6 = 3003. The number of combinations with only one variety is 8 (one for each variety). So the answer is 3003 - 8 = 2995.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag:\nThis is a straightforward combinatorics problem. Using the stars and bars method, we get (8+6-1) choose 6 = 3003 combinations.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety:\nThere are 8 varieties and we need to choose 6, so the number of combinations would be 8 choose 6 = 28.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag:\nWe have 3 blueberry-filled donuts fixed, we need to choose 3 donuts from the remaining 8 varieties (including the possibility of more blueberry-filled donuts). This is (7+3) choose 3 = 120 combinations.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag:\nThis is the total number of combinations without restrictions minus the combinations with three or more blueberry-filled donuts. The first part is 3003 (from part c). For the second part, we consider 3, 4, 5, and 6 blueberry-filled donuts:\n- 3 blueberry-filled donuts: (7+3) choose 3 = 120 combinations.\n- 4 blueberry-filled donuts: (7+2) choose 2 = 36 combinations.\n- 5 blueberry-filled donuts: (7+1) choose 1 = 8 combinations.\n- 6 blueberry-filled donuts: (7+0) choose 0 = 1 combination.\nSo the answer is 3003 - (120 + 36 + 8 + 1) = 2838.", "4#3#1#6#2#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it is impossible to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties since each donut must be unique.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose the bag, as there are 8 varieties available and we can fill the bag with any one of them.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then it is a problem of combinations with repetition, which is calculated as (n+r-1)C(r), where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6). Therefore, there are C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can subtract the number of ways to choose all donuts of the same variety from the total number of ways with no restrictions. So, the answer would be 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have several scenarios to consider. We can have 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts in the bag. For each case, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties, then sum up the results. \n\nCase 1: 0 blueberry donuts. This means we need to choose all 6 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which gives us C(6+7-1, 6) = C(12, 6) = 924 ways.\n\nCase 2: 1 blueberry donut. This means we need to choose the remaining 5 donuts from the other 7 varieties, which gives us C(5+7-1, 5) = C(11, 5) = 462 ways.\n\nCase 3: 2 blueberry donuts. This means we need to choose the remaining 4 donuts from the other 7 varieties, which gives us C(4+7-1, 4) = C(10, 4) = 210 ways.\n\nAdding these up, we get 924 + 462 + 210 = 1596 ways.\n", "4#3#1#6#5#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it is not possible to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties, because each donut chosen must be a different variety.\n\n(b) For some reason, your question does not contain a (b) part.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then it's a problem of combinations with repetitions. The formula is C(n+r-1,r), where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6). So the answer is C(8+6-1,6) = C(13,6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we subtract the 8 ways of choosing all 6 donuts from the same variety from the total number of unrestricted ways, which is 1716. So the answer is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we have to consider three cases: 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts. For each case, we multiply the number of ways to choose the remaining donuts from the other varieties. The total is C(7,3)*C(8,3) + C(7,2)*C(8,4) + C(7,1)*C(8,5) + C(7,0)*C(8,6) = 35*56 + 21*70 + 7*56 + 1*28 = 5040 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we have to consider four cases: 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts. For each case, we multiply the number of ways to choose the remaining donuts from the other varieties. The total is C(7,6)*C(8,0) + C(7,5)*C(8,1) + C(7,4)*C(8,2) + C(7,3)*C(8,3) = 7*1 + 21*8 + 35*28 + 35*56 = 1716 ways.", "4#3#2#1#5#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety:\nThis means we want to choose 6 different varieties from 8. This is a combination problem, denoted as \"8 choose 6\", calculated as 8C6 = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety:\nSince all the donuts are the same, we are essentially choosing 1 variety from 8 possible. So there are 8C1 = 8 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag:\nThis is a problem of combinations with repetition, calculated as \"n + r - 1 choose r\", where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts to choose (6). So, the total ways are \"8 + 6 - 1 choose 6\" = 13C6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag:\nWe can find this by taking the total ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties (from part c) and subtracting the ways where all donuts are of the same variety (from part b). So, the ways are 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag:\nWe can break this down into cases: exactly 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts. For each case, we have to choose the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties.\n\nCase 1: 3 blueberry-filled + 3 others (from 7 varieties): 7C3 * (3+3-1)C3 = 35 * 10 = 350 ways.\nCase 2: 4 blueberry-filled + 2 others (from 7 varieties): 7C2 * (4+2-1)C2 = 21 * 15 = 315 ways.\nCase 3: 5 blueberry-filled + 1 other (from 7 varieties): 7C1 * (5+1-1)C1 = 7 * 5 = 35 ways.\nCase 4: 6 blueberry-filled: 1 way.\n\nSo, the total ways are 350 + 315 + 35 + 1 = 701 ways.", "4#3#2#1#6#": "(a) if there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety?\nThis means you are choosing 6 different varieties of donuts from 8 available varieties. This is simply a combination of choosing 6 from 8. The formula for combination is C(n, r) = n! / [(n-r)! * r!], where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. In this case, n is 8 (8 varieties of donuts) and r is 6 (6 donuts to choose). So C(8, 6) = 8! / [(8-6)! * 6!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) if all donuts in the bag are of the same variety?\nIf all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then you are simply choosing 1 variety out of 8. This is a combination of choosing 1 from 8. So C(8, 1) = 8 ways.\n\n(c) if there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag?\nIf there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then you are choosing 6 donuts out of 8 varieties, with repetition allowed. This is equivalent to a combination with repetition, which is calculated using the formula C(n + r - 1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) if there must be at least two varieties in the bag?\nThis is a bit more complicated. First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties with no restrictions, which we've already determined is 1716. Then subtract the number of ways to choose 6 donuts of the same variety, which is the number of varieties (8). So the answer is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(f) if there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag?\nThis involves several cases. Case 1: No blueberry donuts. This is equivalent to choosing 6 donuts from 7 varieties, so C(13, 6) = 1716 ways. Case 2: One blueberry donut. This is equivalent to choosing 5 donuts from 7 varieties, so C(12, 5) = 792 ways. Case 3: Two blueberry donuts. This is equivalent to choosing 4 donuts from 7 varieties, so C(11, 4) = 330 ways. Add these cases together to get the total: 1716 + 792 + 330 = 2838 ways.", "4#3#2#5#1#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then you are simply choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties without replacement. This can be calculated using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of varieties and k is the number of donuts you want to choose. So, there are C(8, 6) = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then you are simply choosing one variety from 8, which can be done in 8 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then you are choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties with replacement. This can be calculated using the combination with repetition formula C(n + k - 1, k) = (n + k - 1)! / [k!(n - 1)!]. So, there are C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = 3003 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we can calculate the total ways with no restrictions and subtract the ways with all donuts of the same variety.

This can be calculated as C(7 + 3 - 1, 3) = 84 ways. However, we also need to consider the cases where there are 4, 5, and 6 blueberry donuts.

However, since we need at least two varieties, we subtract the number of ways to choose all 6 donuts of the same variety from the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts. So, the answer would be C(8+6-1, 6) - 8 = 3003 - 8 = 2995 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, you can simply use the combination with repetition formula C(n+r-1, r) = (n+r-1)! / [r!(n - 1)!]. With 8 varieties of donuts and choosing 6, the answer would be C(8+6-1, 6) = 3003 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, this means you're choosing one variety out of the 8, for which there are obviously 8 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider three cases: 3 blueberry donuts and 3 of any other variety, 4 blueberry donuts and 2 of any other variety, and 5 or 6 blueberry donuts.

The stars and bars method is a combinatorics technique that is used when we have a multiset and we want to count the number of ways to divide it into a number of subsets. For this case, we have 6 donuts and 8 varieties, so the total number of ways is C(6+8-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716. But this includes the cases where all 6 donuts are of the same variety, which we must subtract. There are 8 varieties, so there are 8 ways to have all 6 donuts of the same variety.

Since we have 6 donuts and 8 varieties to choose from, the number of ways is the number of ways to choose 6 varieties from 8, which is C(8, 6) = 28.

This is a standard problem in combinatorics, and the number of solutions is C(6+8-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716. However, this includes the 8 cases where all 6 donuts are of the same variety.

This can be solved using the Stars and Bars method, which gives the total number of ways as C(n+k-1, k) where n is the number of varieties and k is the number of donuts.

For four, five, and six blueberries, we have C(8, 2) = 28, C(7, 1) = 7, and C(7, 0) = 1 ways respectively.

Therefore, the number of ways with at least two varieties is 1716 - 8 = 1708.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we first choose 3 blueberry donuts, and then choose the remaining 3 donuts from the 8 varieties. The number of ways is (8+3-1)C(3) = 10C3 = 120.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways since there are 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we use the formula for combinations with repetitions, which is (8+6-1)C(6) = 13C6 = 1716.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we consider all scenarios, and then subtract the scenarios where there are 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts. Thus, the number of ways is 1716 - [(8+3-1)C(3) + (8+2-1)C(2) + (8+1-1)C(1) + 8] = 1716 - [120 + 45 + 8 + 8] = 1535.", "4#5#2#6#1#": "(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can simply subtract the number of ways to choose all donuts of the same variety from the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts. There are a total of 8^6 ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties, and 8 ways to choose all 6 donuts of the same variety. So, the answer is 8^6 - 8 = 262136 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider three cases: when there are 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts.

This results in 1,365 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider this as choosing 3 blueberry donuts and then choosing the remaining 3 from the remaining 7 varieties.

The number of ways is 7 choose 3 (for the 3 remaining donuts), plus 7 choose 2 (for 2 remaining donuts) plus 7 choose 1 (for 1 remaining donut) plus 7 choose 0 (if all remaining donuts are blueberry). This results in 64 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, this is a simple combination problem. The number of ways is 8 choose 1 since we are choosing 1 variety out of 8.

So, C(8, 6) = 8! / [6!(8-6)!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, we simply have to choose one variety out of 8. This is again a combination problem, but now we are choosing 1 out of 8.

The formula for this is C(n + k - 1, k) = (n + k - 1)! / [k!(n - 1)!].

This is C(7+6-1, 6) + 7*C(7+5-1, 5) + 7*7*C(7+4-1, 4) = 1716 + 5005 + 5005 = 11726 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag: You can choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties in 3003 ways (using the combination formula C(8+6-1, 6)).\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety: There are 8 varieties, and choosing all 6 donuts of the same variety is only 1 way for each variety, so the answer is 8 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag: This can be calculated by adding the number of ways to choose 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts and then choosing the rest from the remaining 7 varieties. This is 7*C(7+3-1, 3) + 7*7*C(7+2-1, 2) + 7*7*7*C(7+1-1, 1) + 7*7*7*7 = 1716 + 1470 + 343 + 49 = 3578 ways.", "4#6#3#5#1#": "(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we are essentially looking for the number of ways to distribute 6 donuts into 8 slots (varieties) with at least two slots being used. We can use the stars and bars method here. However, since we need at least two varieties, we can subtract cases where only one variety is chosen. So, the total would be C(6+8-1, 6) - 8 = 3003 - 8 = 2995 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we consider two scenarios: when there are no blueberry-filled donuts and when there is one or two blueberry-filled donuts. The total number of ways without restrictions would be C(6+8-1, 6) = 3003. The total ways with one or two blueberry-filled donuts would be C(6+7-1, 6)*2 = 1716. Hence, the total would be 3003 - 1716 = 1287 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we are essentially looking for the number of ways to distribute 6 donuts into 8 slots (varieties), which is a problem of combinations with repetitions allowed. This is given by the formula C(n+k-1, k), where n is the number of varieties and k is the number of donuts. So, there are C(8+6-1, 6) = 3003 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can first choose 3 blueberry-filled donuts, and then distribute the remaining 3 donuts among the 8 varieties. This is given by the formula C(n+k-1, k), where n is the number of varieties and k is the number of remaining donuts. So, there are C(8+3-1, 3) = 120 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then each donut must be of a different variety. This is simply choosing 6 varieties out of 8, and this is a combinations problem. So, there are C(8, 6) = 28 ways.\n", "4#6#3#5#2#": "(a) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then this is a problem of combination with repetition. The formula for combination with repetition is C(n + r - 1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. Here n = 8 and r = 6. So the number of ways is C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then you are simply choosing one variety from the eight available. So the number of ways is C(8, 1) = 8.\n\n(c) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we subtract the ways in which all donuts are of the same variety (case b) from the total number of ways (case a). So the number of ways is 1716 - 8 = 1708.\n\n(d) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we choose 3 blueberry-filled donuts and the remaining 3 from the other 7 varieties. The number of ways is C(3 + 3 - 1, 3) * C(7 + 3 - 1, 3) = C(5, 3) * C(9, 3) = 10 * 84 = 840.\n\n(e) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we have to consider three cases: no blueberry-filled donuts, one blueberry-filled donut, and two blueberry-filled donuts. The number of ways is C(7 + 6 - 1, 6) + 7 * C(7 + 5 - 1, 5) + C(2, 2) * C(7 + 4 - 1, 4) = C(12, 6) + 7 * C(11, 5) + C(6, 4) = 924 + 7 * 462 + 15 = 4029.", "4#6#5#1#2#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this means we need to choose 6 different varieties out of 8.

This can be done in 8 choose 1 = 8 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we need to subtract the ways where only one variety is chosen from all possible combinations. There are 8^6 total ways to fill the bag, and 8 ways to fill the bag with only one variety. So, 8^6 - 8 = 262136 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have several cases: 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts. For 0 blueberry donuts, there are 7^6 ways to fill the bag. For 1 blueberry donut, there are 6 * 7^5 ways (6 positions for the blueberry donut and 7 varieties for the remaining donuts). For 2 blueberry donuts, there are 15 * 7^4 ways (15 combinations to position 2 blueberry donuts and 7 varieties for the remaining donuts).

So the answer is 0.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then we can choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties in C(8+6-1,6) = C(13,6) ways by applying the formula for combinations with repetition.", "4#6#5#2#1#": "(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can subtract the number of ways to choose all donuts of the same variety from the total number of ways to choose six donuts.

So, there are 8^6 - 8 = 262,136 ways to choose six donuts of at least two different varieties.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can subtract the number of ways to choose three or more blueberry-filled donuts from the total number of ways to choose six donuts. To find the number of ways to choose three or more blueberry-filled donuts, we can first choose three, four, five, or six donuts to be blueberry-filled (4 choices) and then choose the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties. So, the number of ways to choose three or more blueberry-filled donuts is 4 * 7^(6-3) + 3 * 7^(6-4) + 2 * 7^(6-5) + 1 * 7^(6-6) = 19,178.

The remaining donuts can be any of the 8 varieties. For each case, we multiply the number of ways to select the blueberry-filled donuts by the number of ways to select the remaining donuts. Summing these gives the total number of ways.

So there are 7^4 ways.\nIn total, there are 7^6 + 7^5 + 7^4 ways to choose the donuts. \n\nPlease note that these calculations assume that there is an unlimited supply of donuts of each variety.", "6#5#3#4#2#": "Let's solve each of these problems one by one.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we are simply choosing 6 donuts out of 8 varieties. This is a classic problem of combinations with repetitions allowed (also known as multiset coefficients). The formula for this is C(n+r-1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So in this case, we have C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then we are simply choosing 1 variety out of 8. This is the simplest kind of combination: C(n, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of varieties we are choosing. So in this case, we have C(8, 1) = 8 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we have to subtract the cases where all donuts are of the same variety from the total unrestricted cases. So we have 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider this problem as first choosing 3 blueberry donuts, and then choosing the remaining 3 donuts from all 8 varieties. So the number of ways is C(3+3-1, 3) * C(8, 1) = C(5, 3) * 8 = 80 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we need to consider three cases: no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, and two blueberry donuts. The sum of these cases will be the total number of ways. So we have C(8+6-1, 6) + C(8+5-1, 5) * C(1, 1) + C(8+4-1, 4) * C(2, 2) = 1716 + 792 + 330 = 2838 ways.", "6#5#4#1#2#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, it means we are choosing one donut from 6 different varieties. This is a combination problem where we are choosing 6 from 8, so the number of ways can be calculated as C(8,6) = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, it means we are choosing one variety from 8. This is a combination problem where we are choosing 1 from 8, so the number of ways can be calculated as C(8,1) = 8 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, it means we have to eliminate the case where all donuts are of the same variety from all possible combinations. So, the total number of ways to choose 6 from 8 is C(8+6-1, 6) = 5005, and we subtract the 8 ways where all donuts are of the same variety, so we have 5005-8 = 4997 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can separate the problem into three cases: 3 blueberry donuts and 3 others, 4 blueberry donuts and 2 others, 5 blueberry donuts and 1 other, and 6 blueberry donuts.

The number of ways for each case can be calculated as C(7+6-1, 6) + 7*C(7+5-1, 5) + C(7,2)*C(7+4-1, 4) = 792 + 2772 + 735 = 4299 ways.", "6#5#4#1#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, that means each donut must be of a different type. But since we need 6 donuts and there are only 8 varieties, this scenario is not possible.\n\n(b) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we can use the combination with repetition formula, which is (n+r-1)C(r) where n is the number of types (8 varieties) and r is the number of items to choose (6 donuts). Hence, the number of ways would be C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(c) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the eight ways of choosing all six donuts of the same variety from the total ways of choosing with no restrictions. Hence, the number of ways would be 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we first choose 3 blueberry-filled donuts, then choose the remaining 3 from the 7 remaining varieties. Hence, the number of ways would be C(7+3-1,3) = C(9,3) = 84 ways.\n\n(e) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we consider three cases: no blueberry-filled donuts, one blueberry-filled donut, and two blueberry-filled donuts. The total number of ways would be C(7+6-1,6) + 7*C(7+5-1,5) + 7*7*C(7+4-1,4) = C(12,6) + 7*C(11,5) + 49*C(10,4) = 924 + 7*462 + 49*210 = 15258 ways.", "6#5#4#2#1#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, there are zero ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties.

This is because we can choose any of the 8 varieties to fill the entire bag.\n\n(c) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can think of this as choosing the 2 varieties first and then distributing the rest of the donuts.

We need to consider scenarios where we have 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 different varieties. \nFor 2 varieties, we can select the varieties in 8 choose 2 ways and then distribute the 6 donuts among these 2 varieties in 6 - 1 = 5 ways (using the stars and bars concept). So, that's 28 * 5 = 140 ways.\nFor 3 to 6 varieties, the calculation becomes more complex due to the different ways to distribute the donuts among the varieties. However, for a simpler approximation, we can say that the number of ways will be significantly more than for 2 varieties.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag: This can be calculated using a concept in combinatorics called \"stars and bars\". We are choosing 6 donuts (stars) from 8 varieties (bars). The formula is (n+k-1) choose k, where n is the number of varieties and k is the number of donuts.

The formula for this is (n+r-1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So in this case, it would be (8+6-1) choose 6, which equals 792.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we subtract the number of ways to choose all 6 donuts from one variety from the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts with no restrictions. There are 8 ways to choose all 6 donuts from one variety, so the number of ways to choose 6 donuts from at least two varieties is 792 - 8 = 784.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we can break this down into three cases: exactly 3, 4, or 5 blueberry donuts. For each case, we choose the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties. So the number of ways is (7+3-1 choose 3) + (7+2-1 choose 2) + (7+1-1 choose 1), which equals 220.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we can break this down into four cases: no blueberry, exactly 1, 2, or 3 blueberry donuts.

We would first count the total combinations (which we know from (c) is 1716), then subtract the combinations where all 6 donuts are of the same variety (which we know from (b) is 8).

The formula for combinations with repetition is C(n+r-1, r), where n is the number of different types and r is the number of items to be chosen.

As we calculated in (b), there are 8 ways to do this.

As there are 8 varieties, there are 8 ways to choose.\n\n(c) There are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then we are dealing with a problem of combinations with repetition.

As calculated in part (c), there are 1716 total ways to fill the bag. From part (b), we know there are 8 ways to fill the bag with only one variety. So, the answer is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.", "1#2#6#5#4#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it is not possible to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties because you'd only be able to choose up to 8 donuts, one from each variety.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts because there are 8 varieties of donuts.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then this becomes a bit complex. You could have 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts, and then the rest are chosen from the remaining 7 varieties. This can be calculated as follows:\n  - 0 blueberry: C(7,6) ways\n  - 1 blueberry: C(7,5) ways\n  - 2 blueberry: C(7,4) ways\nSumming these up gives C(7,6) + C(7,5) + C(7,4) = 7 + 21 + 35 = 63 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then this becomes:\n  - 3 blueberry: C(7,3) ways\n  - 4 blueberry: C(7,2) ways\n  - 5 blueberry: C(7,1) ways\n  - 6 blueberry: C(7,0) ways\nSumming these up gives C(7,3) + C(7,2) + C(7,1) + C(7,0) = 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then this becomes a bit complex. Essentially, this is the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties (8^6) minus the number of ways to choose 6 donuts all of the same variety (8). So the answer is 8^6 - 8 = 262,136.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then each of the 6 donuts can be of any of the 8 varieties, so the total number of ways is 8^6 = 262,144.", "1#3#2#4#5#6#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it's not possible to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties since each bag can only contain one donut of each variety.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts because there are 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then this is a problem of combinations with replacement. The formula for this is (n+r-1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So there are C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we subtract the 8 ways of choosing all of the same variety from the total calculated in part (c). So there are 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we choose 3 blueberry-filled donuts and 3 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. This is C(7+3-1, 3) = C(9, 3) = 84 ways. But we could also have 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts, so we need to add those possibilities.

Since there are 8 varieties, there are 8 ways to do this.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then this is a problem of combinations with repetition. The formula for this is (n+r-1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts.

This is a problem of combinations with repetition, and the formula for this is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6).

The formula is C(n+r-1, r) where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. Plugging in the numbers, we get C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the number of ways to choose all donuts of the same variety (which is 8) from the total number of ways to choose with no restrictions (which is 1716).

For each scenario, we calculate the number of ways to fill the rest of the bag, and then add these up. For no blueberry-filled donuts, we have C(7+6-1,6) = 792 ways. For 1 blueberry-filled donuts, we have C(7+5-1,5) = 252 ways. For 2 blueberry-filled donuts, we have C(7+4-1,4) = 210 ways.

For 0 blueberry donuts, it's (7 + 6 - 1) choose 6 = 792 ways. For 1 blueberry donut, it's (7 + 5 - 1) choose 5 = 792 ways. For 2 blueberry donuts, it's (7 + 4 - 1) choose 4 = 330 ways.

Therefore, there are (8+6-1)C(6) = 13C6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the 8 ways of having all donuts of the same variety from the total number of unrestricted ways. Therefore, there are 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have three cases: 3 blueberry-filled and 3 of other varieties, 4 blueberry-filled and 2 of other varieties, or all 6 are blueberry-filled. This is a bit more complex to calculate and would depend on how you count \"varieties\". \n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider all the possibilities of having 0, 1, or 2 blueberry-filled donuts and the remaining donuts being of other varieties. Again, this would be a bit more complex to calculate and would depend on how you count \"varieties\".", "1#4#3#2#6#5#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, the number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties is 0, because you can't pick 6 different varieties from only 8 varieties without repeating.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts, because there are 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, you can use the formula of combinations with repetitions, also known as multiset coefficients. The formula is (n+r-1)Cr, where n is the number of varieties (8 in this case) and r is the number of donuts (6 in this case). So, the number of ways is (8+6-1)C6 = 13C6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the ways with only one variety (which is 8 as calculated in part b) from the total ways with no restrictions (which is 1716 as calculated in part c). So, the number of ways is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we treat the three blueberry donuts as one unit. Then we are choosing 4 units (3 donuts + 1 unit of the 3 blueberry donuts) from 8 varieties which is 8C4 = 70 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we need to calculate the number of ways with 0, 1 or 2 blueberry donuts and sum these up. For 0 blueberry donut, it's 7C6 = 7 ways. For 1 blueberry donut, we choose 5 from the remaining 7 varieties, which is 7C5 = 21 ways. For 2 blueberry donuts, we choose 4 from the remaining 7 varieties, which is 7C4 = 35 ways. So, the total number of ways is 7 + 21 + 35 = 63 ways.", "1#4#3#5#2#6#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it's not possible to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties, since each donut would need to be a different variety.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts, since there are 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then you are dealing with a problem of combinations with repetition. The number of ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties is given by the formula C(n + r - 1, r) where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. Therefore, there are C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, subtract the number of ways to choose all donuts of the same variety (8 ways) from the total number of combinations with no restrictions. Therefore, there are 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you need to consider three cases: 3, 4, 5, and 6 blueberry-filled donuts. For each case, use the combinations with repetition formula for the remaining donuts and sum the results:\n\n- 3 blueberry-filled donuts and 3 from the remaining 7 varieties: C(7 + 3 - 1, 3) = C(9, 3) = 84 ways.\n- 4 blueberry-filled donuts and 2 from the remaining 7 varieties: C(7 + 2 - 1, 2) = C(8, 2) = 28 ways.\n- 5 blueberry-filled donuts and 1 from the remaining 7 varieties: C(7 + 1 - 1, 1) = C(7, 1) = 7 ways.\n- 6 blueberry-filled donuts and 0 from the remaining 7 varieties: C(7 + 0 - 1, 0) = C(6, 0) = 1 way.\n\nSo, there are 84 + 28 + 7 + 1 = 120 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, consider four cases: 0, 1, and 2 blueberry-filled donuts.

So there are 8 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we are dealing with a problem of combinations with repetition. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations with repetition: C(n + r - 1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts.

We need to calculate for 3, 4, 5, and 6 blueberry-filled donuts and subtract these from the total. But as the total varieties of donuts we have is 8, so the maximum number of blueberry-filled donuts can be 8. So, we subtract the ways with 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 blueberry-filled donuts from the total. The total ways is 1716. Now, we calculate for each and subtract: 1716 - C(10, 3) - C(9, 4) - C(8, 5) - C(7, 6) - C(6, 7) - C(5, 8) = 1716 - 120 - 126 - 56 - 15 - 6 - 1 = 1392 ways.", "1#4#3#6#2#5#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it is not possible to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties because each donut would have to be of a different variety.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to do this because there are 8 different varieties to choose from.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then this is a problem of combinations with repetition, which can be calculated using the formula (n + r - 1) C r.

In this case, the formula is C(n+r-1, r-1) where n is the number of objects to choose from (in this case, donuts), and r is the number of objects to choose (in this case, varieties).

This is a problem of combinations with repetition, which is given by the formula C(n + r - 1, r), where n is the number of groups and r is the number of items.

As there are 8 varieties to choose from, you have 8 ways to do this.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of combinations with repetition (also known as multiset). The formula for this is C(n + r - 1, r), where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6).

The formula for this is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts we want.

Therefore, we subtract the ways we can have all donuts of the same type from the total ways without restrictions. That is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider the scenarios when there are 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts. For each scenario, we calculate the number of ways to distribute the rest of the donuts among the remaining 7 types. This can be calculated as C(7+k-1,k) for each scenario and sum up the results. The total number of ways is C(7+3-1,3) + C(7+2-1,2) + C(7+1-1,1) + C(7+0-1,0) = 220 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 249 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider the scenarios when there are 0, 1, or 2 blueberry-filled donuts. For each scenario, we calculate the number of ways to distribute the rest of the donuts among the remaining 7 types. This can be calculated as C(7+k-1,k) for each scenario and sum up the results. The total number of ways is C(7+6-1,6) + C(7+5-1,5) + C(7+4-1,4) = 792 + 252 + 56 = 1100 ways.", "1#5#4#2#6#3#": "(a) If no two donuts in the bag can be of the same variety, then there are no ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties since the bag of 6 donuts can't have duplicates.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider three scenarios: \n1. 3 blueberry-filled donuts + 3 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. \n2. 4 blueberry-filled donuts + 2 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. \n3. 5 blueberry-filled donuts + 1 donut from the remaining 7 varieties. \n4. All 6 donuts are blueberry-filled. \n\nFor the first scenario, the number of ways = C(7,3) = 35.\nFor the second scenario, the number of ways = C(7,2) = 21.\nFor the third scenario, the number of ways = C(7,1) = 7.\nFor the fourth scenario, there's only 1 way. \nSo, the total number of ways = 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, the only scenario we need to avoid is all 6 donuts of the same variety. So, the total number of ways = total ways without restrictions - ways with all donuts of the same variety. \n\nThe total ways without restrictions is 8^6 = 262144.\nThe ways with all donuts of the same variety = 8 (since there are 8 varieties).\nSo, the total number of ways = 262144 - 8 = 262136.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways (since there are 8 varieties).\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider four scenarios:\n1.

The formula is (n+k-1) choose k, where n is the number of varieties (8) and k is the number of donuts (6). So the number of ways is (8+6-1) choose 6 = 13 choose 6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is equivalent to subtracting the ways in which all donuts are of the same variety (which we computed in part b) from the total number of ways (which we computed in part c). So the number of ways is 1716 - 8 = 1708.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can choose 3 blueberry-filled donuts in 1 way, and the remaining 3 donuts can be any of the 8 varieties. So the number of ways is (8+3-1) choose 3 = 10 choose 3 = 120 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we need to subtract the ways in which there are three or more blueberry-filled donuts from the total number of ways. The number of ways to choose 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts are 120, 56, 8, and 1, respectively. So the number of ways is 1716 - (120 + 56 + 8 + 1) = 1531.", "1#5#4#3#6#2#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then we cannot choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties because we can't have duplicates. Therefore, there are 0 ways to do this.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then we are essentially choosing 1 variety from the 8 available. So, there are 8 ways to do this.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we can think of this as a problem of combinations with repetition. This is often solved with the formula (n+k-1) choose k, where n is the number of varieties and k is the number of donuts. So the answer would be (8+6-1) choose 6 = 13 choose 6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is all the cases from part (c) excluding those where all the donuts are the same variety (from part (b)).

So, there are C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13,6) = 1716 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we need to subtract the number of ways all donuts can be the same from the total number of unrestricted ways. So, it's 1716 (from c) - 8 (from b) = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we need to treat these three blueberry-filled donuts as a single variety.

The formula for combinations with repetition is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts.

This is because you can choose any of the 8 varieties to fill the bag.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, the number of ways to choose is equivalent to the number of ways to distribute 6 indistinguishable objects (donuts) into 8 distinguishable boxes (varieties), allowing for some boxes to be empty.

This is a problem of combination with repetition, calculated using the formula C(n+r-1,r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts.

The total number of ways is (5 + 8 - 1) C 5 + (5 + 7 - 1) C 5 + (5 + 6 - 1) C 5 = 792 + 792 + 792 = 2376 ways.", "1#6#2#4#5#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then we can't choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties because we would only be able to choose 1 donut from each variety.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose the 6 donuts, because there are 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then this is a problem of combinations with repetition. The formula for this is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. Substituting the given values, we have (8 + 6 - 1) choose 6 = 13 choose 6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we can subtract the 8 ways in which all donuts are of the same variety from the total number of ways without restrictions. So, 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we can consider this as choosing 3 blueberry-filled donuts and 3 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which is 7 choose 3 = 35 ways. Alternatively, we can choose 4 blueberry-filled donuts and 2 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which is 7 choose 2 = 21 ways.

For 0 blueberry-filled donuts, we're choosing 6 from the remaining 7 varieties, which is (7 + 6 - 1) choose 6 = 792 ways. For 1 blueberry-filled donut, we're choosing 5 from the remaining 7 varieties, which is (7 + 5 - 1) choose 5 = 792 ways. For 2 blueberry-filled donuts, we're choosing 4 from the remaining 7 varieties, which is (7 + 4 - 1) choose 4 = 330 ways. Adding these together, we get 792 + 792 + 330 = 1914 ways.", "1#6#2#5#3#4#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then the number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties is equivalent to the number of ways to choose 6 varieties from 8, which is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / [(n-k)!k!], where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial. Here, n=8 and k=6, so C(8, 6) = 8! / [(8-6)!6!] = 28 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, the calculation will be more complex. You would need to consider different cases separately: 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts. For each case, you would calculate the number of ways to fill the rest of the bag with donuts of other varieties, and sum up these possibilities. This involves combinations and addition.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then the number of ways to choose the donuts is just equal to the number of varieties, because you're effectively just choosing one variety. Since there are 8 varieties, there are 8 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, the calculation will be similar to (f), but now the cases to consider are 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts. Again, for each case, you would calculate the number of ways to fill the rest of the bag with donuts of other varieties, and sum up these possibilities.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then this is a problem of combinations with repetition (also known as multiset or combination with replacement). The formula for this is C(n + k - 1, k) = (n + k - 1)! / [(n - 1)!k!], where n is the number of varieties and k is the number of donuts to choose. Here, n=8 and k=6, so C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = 13! / [(8 - 1)!6!] = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, you would subtract from the total number of unrestricted combinations the number of combinations that have only one variety. This is because the combinations with only one variety are exactly the ones that do not satisfy the condition of having at least two varieties. So the calculation is 1716 (from (c)) - 8 (from (b)) = 1708 ways.", "1#6#2#5#4#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it's impossible to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties because each donut in the bag must be of a different variety.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 different ways to do this because there are 8 different varieties to choose from.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, you are choosing 6 donuts out of 8 varieties with repetition. This can be solved by a formula for combinations with repetition: (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So, the number of ways is (8 + 6 - 1) choose 6 = 13 choose 6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we can subtract the number of ways with only one variety (which is 8 from part b) from the total number of ways with no restrictions (which is 1716 from part c).

The formula for this is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So it would be (8 + 6 - 1) choose 6, which equals 792 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we subtract from the total number of ways (calculated in part c) the number of ways where all donuts are of the same variety (calculated in part b).

The formula for this is C(n+r-1,r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts to choose.

This is a combination with replacement problem, and the formula is C(n + r - 1, r) = (n + r - 1)! / [(n - 1)! * r!].

Therefore, there are 0 ways to do this.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then we are simply choosing 1 variety out of 8 to fill the bag. So, there are 8 ways to do this.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we can use the stars and bars method, which gives us \"n+k-1 choose k-1\" combinations.

The formula to calculate this is C(n+r-1, r) where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts to choose (6). So, the answer is C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) if there must be at least two varieties in the bag?\n\nThere are 1716 total unrestricted ways (from part c).

So the total number of ways is 8^3 (for 3 blueberry donuts) + 8^2 (for 4 blueberry donuts) + 8^1 (for 5 blueberry donuts) + 1 (for 6 blueberry donuts) = 512 + 64 + 8 + 1 = 585 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we subtract from the total number of ways (from (c)) the 8 ways where all donuts are of the same variety (from (b)).

This can be solved by using the stars and bars method, which is (n+k-1) choose k. Here, n is the number of varieties (8), and k is the number of donuts (6).

This would be equivalent to finding the number of ways to distribute 6 identical items (donuts) into 8 distinct groups (varieties). The formula for this is (n+r-1) choose r, where n is the number of groups (8 varieties) and r is the number of items (6 donuts). So, (8+6-1) choose 6 = 13 choose 6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider different cases: no blueberry donut, one blueberry donut, and two blueberry donuts.

This is because each of the 8 varieties could fill the entire bag.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then this is simply a combination problem. The number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!], where n is the number of total options (8 varieties), r is the number of choices to be made (6 donuts), and \"!\" denotes factorial. So, C(8, 6) = 8! / [6!(8-6)!] = 28 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have several scenarios: no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, or two blueberry donuts. \n\n- No blueberry donuts: This is equivalent to choosing 6 donuts from 7 varieties (since blueberry is not an option), so C(7, 6) = 7 ways.\n- One blueberry donut: Choose 1 from blueberry, and 5 from the other 7 varieties, so 1 * C(7, 5) = 21 ways.\n- Two blueberry donuts: Choose 2 from blueberry, and 4 from the other 7 varieties, so 1 * C(7, 4) = 35 ways.\nAdding them up, there are 7 + 21 + 35 = 63 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this means we cannot have a bag of 6 donuts of the same variety. From part (c), we know there are 28 ways to choose 6 donuts with no restrictions. From part (b), we know there are 8 ways where all the donuts are the same variety.

Adding all these together, there are 7 + 21 + 35 = 63 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract from the total number of ways the number of ways with only one variety.

The formula for this is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6). So, (8 + 6 - 1) choose 6 equals 792 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we have to consider two cases. One is when there are no blueberry-filled donuts and one is when there are exactly two blueberry-filled donuts. The first case is like part (c) but with 7 varieties instead of 8, so (7 + 6 - 1) choose 6 equals 792. The second case is when there are two blueberry-filled donuts and 4 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, so 1 * (7 + 4 - 1) choose 4 equals 210.

Hence, it will be (8+6-1) choose 6, which equals 792 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, subtract the number of ways when all donuts are of the same variety (8) from the total number of ways (792), so there are 792 - 8 = 784 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, the remaining 3 donuts can be of any variety. This is equivalent to choosing 3 donuts from 8 varieties, which is (8+3-1) choose 3, or 120 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, this is the total number of ways (792) minus the ways when there are at least three blueberry-filled donuts (120), which gives 792 - 120 = 672 ways.", "2#4#3#1#6#5#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose, because we have 8 different varieties.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the 8 ways of choosing donuts of the same variety from the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties. The total ways without restrictions can be found using the \"combination with repetition\" formula (also known as multiset), which is (n+k-1) choose k, where n is the number of varieties and k is the number of donuts. So, total ways = (8+6-1) choose 6 = 3003. So, there are 3003 - 8 = 2995 ways to choose at least two varieties.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, as calculated in (d), there are 3003 ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this means we are only selecting 6 different varieties out of 8, which is a simple combination problem. So, there are 8 choose 6 = 28 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we consider three scenarios: no blueberry-filled donuts, one blueberry-filled donut, and two blueberry-filled donuts. For each scenario, we calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties. So, the total ways = (7+6-1) choose 6 + (7+5-1) choose 5 + (7+4-1) choose 4 = 792 + 792 + 330 = 1914 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we consider three scenarios: three blueberry-filled donuts, four blueberry-filled donuts, and six blueberry-filled donuts. For each scenario, we calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties.

The total ways without restrictions is 8^6 = 262,144. The ways with only one variety is the answer to (b), which is 8. So, the answer is 262,144 - 8 = 262,136.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, as stated above, there are 8^6 = 262,144 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, it means we have fixed 3 donuts, and we have to choose the other 3 from 8 varieties (including the blueberry), which gives us 8^3 = 512 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this is the same as choosing 6 from 8 with no repetition, which gives us C(8,6) = 28 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we calculate the ways with no blueberry-filled donuts (7^6), one blueberry-filled donut (C(6,1)*7^5), and two blueberry-filled donuts (C(6,2)*7^4), and add them all together. This gives us 7^6 + C(6,1)*7^5 + C(6,2)*7^4 = 117,649 + 186,624 + 163,020 = 467,293 ways.", "2#4#3#5#6#1#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose a bag, as each variety of donut can form a bag of 6 donuts.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, you would first have to calculate the number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties with no restrictions. This can be calculated using combination formula C(n+r-1, r) where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6). C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716. Then subtract the number of ways when all donuts are the same variety (8). So the answer would be 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we use the same combination formula as in the previous case, which gives us 1716 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can think of it in three scenarios: 3, 4, 5 or 6 blueberry donuts. For each scenario, the remaining donuts can be of any variety. This can be calculated as C(8+3-1, 3) + C(8+2-1, 2) + C(8+1-1, 1) + C(8+0-1, 0) = 220 + 36 + 8 + 1 = 265 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you would need to calculate the total possible combinations without restrictions (1716) then subtract the scenarios where there are 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts. We already calculated this as 265. So the answer would be 1716 - 265 = 1451 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, since there are 8 varieties and you need to select 6, this would simply be the number of ways to choose 6 out of 8, which is a combination C(8, 6) = 28 ways.", "2#4#3#6#1#5#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then the number of ways is simply the number of varieties, which is 8. \n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we first consider the total ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties which is 8^6.

So, the number of ways is 8^6 - 8.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then each donut can be any of the 8 varieties. So, the number of ways is 8^6.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we need to consider the case where there are 0, 1, or 2 blueberry-filled donuts. This would be (8^6 - 7^6) + (8^5 - 7^5) + (8^4 - 7^4).\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then this is simply a combination problem, and we have to choose 6 different varieties from 8. So, the number of ways is 8C6 = 28.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we need to consider the cases where there are 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts.

There are C(8, 2) ways to choose 2 varieties, and then for each of these choices there are C(4 + 2 - 1, 4) ways to distribute the remaining 4 donuts, by the formula for combinations with repetition. So the total number of ways is C(8, 2) * C(5, 4) = 280.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a combination with repetition problem. The formula for this is C(n + r - 1, r), where n is the number of types and r is the number of items to choose. Here n = 8 and r = 6, so the number of ways is C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we need to consider three cases: no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, and two blueberry donuts. For each case, we use the combinations with repetition formula to find the number of ways to choose the remaining donuts, and sum the results. So the total number of ways is C(7 + 6 - 1, 6) + 7*C(7 + 5 - 1, 5) + C(7, 1)*C(7 + 4 - 1, 4) = 792 + 1470 + 1050 = 3312.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we need to consider four cases: three blueberry donuts, four blueberry donuts, five blueberry donuts, and six blueberry donuts. For each case, we use the combinations with repetition formula to find the number of ways to choose the remaining donuts, and sum the results.

So, there are 8 ways to do this.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, you have to subtract the ways in which only one variety can be chosen (which we found was 8 in part b) from the total ways with no restrictions. Using the formula for combinations (nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!) where n=8 (varieties) and r=6 (donuts), the total ways with no restrictions is 8C6 = 28. So, there are 28 - 8 = 20 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties with at least two varieties in the bag.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can fix 3 donuts as blueberry-filled. The remaining 3 donuts can be any from the 8 varieties. So, using the combination formula, the number of ways is 8C3 = 56.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, it means each donut is of a different variety. But since there are only 8 varieties and we need to choose 6, the number of ways is the same as choosing 6 varieties from 8, which is 8C6 = 28.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we can choose 6 donuts of any variety. This can be viewed as a problem of distributing 6 identical items (donuts) into 8 distinct groups (varieties), which is a problem of combinations with repetition, solved using the formula (n+r-1)C(r) where n=8 and r=6. So the number of ways is (8+6-1)C6 = 13C6 = 1716.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider three cases: no blueberry-filled, one blueberry-filled, and two blueberry-filled. For each case, the remaining donuts can be of any variety. So, the total number of ways is (8C0 * 7C6) + (8C1 * 7C5) + (8C2 * 7C4) = 1*7 + 8*21 + 28*35 = 1127.", "2#4#5#1#6#3#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then you are essentially choosing 1 variety out of 8. So there are 8 ways to do this.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we will have to consider combinations of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 donuts from different varieties. This can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of varieties and k is the number of varieties chosen. For 2 varieties, it's C(8, 2), for 3 it's C(8, 3), and so on. Summing up these combinations gives 247 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we have 3 situations: 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts.

It can be calculated using the formula C(n + k - 1, k) = (n + k - 1)! / [k!(n-1)!]. Here, n is the number of varieties (8) and k is the number of donuts chosen (6). This results in C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.", "2#4#5#3#1#6#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose. This is because we have 8 varieties to choose from, and we're choosing one variety.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is a more complex problem. The simplest approach is to first calculate the total number of possibilities (as in (c)) and then subtract those that only have one variety (as in (b)). There are 8^6 = 262144 total possibilities, and 8 possibilities with only one variety, so there are 262144 - 8 = 262136 ways to choose.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can think of this as a problem of choosing 3, 4, 5, or 6 donuts from one variety and the rest from 7 other varieties. This gives us (1 * 7^(6-3)) + (1 * 7^(6-4)) + (1 * 7^(6-5)) + (1 * 7^(6-6)) = 2401 + 343 + 49 + 1 = 2794 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we can choose each of the 6 donuts independently from the 8 varieties, giving us 8^6 = 262144 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this is not possible since we're trying to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties without repeating, which would require having more than 8 donuts to choose from.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, this is equivalent to the total number of ways to choose (as in (c)), minus those that have 3 or more blueberry-filled donuts (as calculated in (e)).

Since there are 8 ways to choose 6 donuts of the same variety and 28 ways to choose 6 donuts with no restrictions (from (c)), there are 28 - 8 = 20 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts with at least two varieties.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider three scenarios: three, four, or five blueberry-filled donuts.

This is a problem of combinations with repetition, which is given by the formula C(n+r-1, r) where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts.

Let's solve them one by one.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this means that we need to choose 6 different types of donuts from 8 available. This is a basic combination problem and can be solved as \"8 choose 6\". The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / [(n-k)! * k!] where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, the answer is C(8,6) = 28.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, this means we are choosing 1 variety from the 8 available to fill the bag with.

So it would be (8+6-1 choose 6) = 3003 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, it means you are choosing 6 different varieties from 8, which is given by the combination formula (8 choose 6) = 28 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you would calculate the number of ways to choose 3 blueberry-filled donuts and then multiply this by the number of ways to choose the remaining 3 donuts from the other 7 varieties. This would be (1 choose 1)*(7 choose 3) = 35 ways.", "2#4#6#3#5#1#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts because there are 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We subtract the ways where all donuts are the same from the total ways. There are 8^6 total ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties (because for each of the 6 donuts, there are 8 possibilities), and 8 ways where all donuts are the same. So, the answer is 8^6 - 8 = 262,136.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider cases: 0 blueberry donuts, 1 blueberry donut, and 2 blueberry donuts. The number of ways to choose for each case is (7^6, 7^5 * 8, and 7^4 * 8C2) respectively. Adding these up gives 781,25 + 56,32 + 12,06 = 849,13.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then for each of the 6 donuts, there are 8 possibilities.

The number of ways to choose for each case is (7^3 * 8C3, 7^2 * 8C4, 7 * 8C5, and 8C6) respectively. Adding these up gives 21,952 + 6,720 + 1,344 + 28 = 30,044.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then for each donut chosen, there is one less variety available. So, the total number of ways is 8*7*6*5*4*3 = 20,160.", "2#4#6#5#1#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, the number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties is the number of ways to choose 6 out of 8, which is a combination. In this case, we would use the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / r!(n - r)!. Here, n is the total number of donuts (8) and r is the number of donuts to be selected (6). The answer is C(8, 6) = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to do this because we have 8 different types of donuts to choose from.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we are choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties with repetition allowed. This is a problem of combination with repetition, which uses the formula C(n + r - 1, r) = (n + r - 1)! / r!(n - 1)!. Here, n is the number of donut varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts chosen (6). So we have C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the number of ways to choose all donuts of the same variety from the total number of combinations. So, it's 1716 (from part c) - 8 (from part b) = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, there are 4 donuts left to choose from 8 varieties. This can be done in C(8 + 4 - 1, 4) = C(11, 4) = 330 ways. But we must consider the cases where there are 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts as well. So, we have 330 + C(8 + 2 - 1, 2) + C(8 + 1 - 1, 1) + C(8, 0) = 330 + 36 + 8 + 1 = 375 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, this is the total number of possibilities (from part c) minus the cases where there are 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts (from part e).

This is because there are 8 varieties of donuts to choose from, and you're choosing one variety to fill the entire bag.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, you would choose 2 varieties from 8 (which is 28 ways), then distribute the remaining 4 donuts among the two chosen varieties. There are 5 ways to do this (4 and 0, 3 and 1, 2 and 2, 1 and 3, 0 and 4), so the total is 28*5 = 140 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then you would count the total ways (as in part c) and subtract the ways with three, four, five, and six blueberry-filled donuts. There are 8^6 total ways to fill the bag, 8^5 ways to have exactly three blueberry-filled donuts, 8^4 ways to have exactly four, 8^3 ways to have exactly five, and 8^2 ways to have exactly six.

Three blueberry donuts and the other three from any of the remaining 7 varieties: This is 7^3.\n2. Four blueberry donuts and the other two from any of the remaining 7 varieties: This is 7^2.\n3. Five blueberry donuts and the other one from any of the remaining 7 varieties: This is 7.\n4. All six are blueberry donuts: This is 1.\nSo, the total number of ways is 7^3 + 7^2 + 7 + 1 = 399.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this is a combination problem. The number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties is 8C6 = 28.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of combinations with repetition. The formula is (n+k-1)Ck, where n is the number of varieties (8) and k is the number of donuts (6).

This is a combination problem where we need to choose 6 different varieties from 8, so there are C(8,6) = 28 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is the total number of ways without restrictions minus the ways with all donuts of the same variety. So, there are 8^6 - 8 = 262,136 ways.", "2#5#3#6#4#1#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts because there are 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider three scenarios: exactly 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts. For each scenario, the remaining donuts can be of any variety. Using the combination formula, we get:\n\n- 3 blueberry donuts: C(7,3) = 35 ways\n- 4 blueberry donuts: C(7,2) = 21 ways\n- 5 blueberry donuts: C(7,1) = 7 ways\n- 6 blueberry donuts: C(7,0) = 1 way\n\nSo, in total, there are 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we can use the combination with repetition formula (n + r - 1 choose r) where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So, we have C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we consider the following scenarios: no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, or two blueberry donuts. For each scenario, the remaining donuts can be of any variety:\n\n- 0 blueberry donuts: C(7 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(12, 6) = 924 ways\n- 1 blueberry donuts: C(7 + 5 - 1, 5) = C(11, 5) = 462 ways\n- 2 blueberry donuts: C(7 + 4 - 1, 4) = C(10, 4) = 210 ways\n\nSo, in total, there are 924 + 462 + 210 = 1596 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the cases where all the donuts are of the same variety from the total possible cases without restrictions. So, there are 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, we use the combination formula C(8,6) = 28 ways because we can't choose more than one donut from each variety.", "2#5#4#1#3#6#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety:\nThis scenario is not possible because there are 8 varieties and you are trying to choose 6 donuts with no two of the same variety. \n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety:\nThis is simply the number of varieties, which is 8. So, there are 8 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag:\nThis is a problem of combinations with repetitions, which can be solved using the formula (n+r-1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So, (8+6-1) choose 6 = 13 choose 6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag:\nFirst, calculate the total number of combinations (from part (c)), and then subtract the number of combinations where all donuts are of the same variety (from part (b)). So, 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag:\nThe remaining 3 donuts can be of any variety. This is a problem of combinations with repetitions, which can be solved using the formula (n+r-1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of remaining donuts.

So, 1716 - [(8+3-1) choose 3 + (8+2-1) choose 2 + (8+1-1) choose 1 + (8+0-1) choose 0] = 1716 - [120 + 45 + 8 + 1] = 1542 ways.", "2#5#4#1#6#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety: This situation isn't possible since there are only 8 varieties and we need to choose 6 donuts.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety: In this case, the number of ways is equivalent to the number of varieties. So there are 8 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag: This is a problem of combinations with repetition. The formula is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6).

We use the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n - r)!].\n\n    - Case 1: There are exactly 3 blueberry donuts. The remaining 3 donuts can be any of the 8 varieties (including blueberry). Thus, there are C(8, 3) = 56 ways.\n    - Case 2: There are more than 3 blueberry donuts. This breaks down into three sub-cases: 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts. For each sub-case, the remaining donuts can be any variety. These are C(8, 2) = 28, C(8, 1) = 8, and C(8, 0) = 1 ways, respectively.\n    - Adding all cases together, there are 56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = 93 total ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the 8 ways of having all donuts of the same variety (from part b) from the total ways without restrictions (from part c, which we will calculate below). \n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we can view this problem as a combination with repetition problem. The formula for this is C(n + r - 1, r) = (n + r - 1)! / [r!(n - 1)!]. Here, n = 8 (varieties) and r = 6 (donuts).

This is a combination problem, so we use the combination formula C(n,k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!].\n\n- Case 1: 3 blueberry and 3 others. The other 3 can be any of the remaining 7 varieties. This is C(7,3) = 35 ways. \n- Case 2: 4 blueberry and 2 others. The other 2 can be any of the remaining 7 varieties. This is C(7,2) = 21 ways.\n- Case 3: 5 blueberry and 1 other.

In each case, we use combinations to calculate the number of ways to choose the non-blueberry donuts.

The total number of ways with no restrictions is 8^6 = 262144. The number of ways with only one variety is 8 (as in part (b)).

So, the answer is 8^6 - [(1*7^3)+(1*7^4)+(1*7^5)+(1*7^6)].\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this is simply a combination calculation, because order does not matter and each variety can only be chosen once. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / [r!(n-r)!], where n is the total number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts chosen (6). So, the answer is 8C6 = 28.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, each of the 6 donuts can be any of the 8 varieties. So, the answer is 8^6 = 262,144.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, this is similar to (f), but we are looking for the ways to have three or more blueberry donuts instead of subtracting them. The answer is (1*7^3)+(1*7^4)+(1*7^5)+(1*7^6).\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is the total ways minus the ways with only one variety. The total ways is 8^6, and the ways with only one variety is 8. So, the answer is 8^6 - 8 = 262,136.", "2#6#1#4#3#5#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts. This is because you have 8 varieties and you can only choose one of them.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider two cases: one with no blueberry donuts and one with two blueberry donuts. The number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 7 varieties (ignoring blueberry) is C(7+6-1,6) = 792. The number of ways to choose 4 donuts from 7 varieties (since we have 2 blueberry donuts) is C(7+4-1,4) = 210. So, the total number of ways is 792 + 210 = 1002.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then you can't choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties because it would mean having at least two donuts of the same variety. \n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the 8 ways of having 6 donuts of the same variety from the total ways of selecting 6 donuts from 8 varieties. So the total number of ways is C(8+6-1,6) - 8 = 3003 - 8 = 2995.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then the number of ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties is given by the combination with repetition formula C(n+r-1,r) = C(8+6-1,6) = 3003.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider four cases: one with three blueberry donuts, one with four, one with five, and one with six. The number of ways to choose 3, 2, 1, and 0 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties are C(7+3-1,3) = 84, C(7+2-1,2) = 36, C(7+1-1,1) = 7, and C(7+0-1,0) = 1 respectively. So, the total number of ways is 84 + 36 + 7 + 1 = 128.", "2#6#1#4#5#3#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose the bag. This is because you have 8 varieties to choose from and you're picking just one.\n\n(f) This question is more complex. In general, if there are no restrictions, the number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties (with repetition) is given by the combination with repetition formula C(n+r-1, r) = C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways. However, since there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts, we must subtract the cases where there are 3, 4, 5, and 6 blueberry-filled donuts. These cases are respectively C(10,3), C(9,2), C(8,1), and C(7,0), which sum up to 120+36+8+1=165. So, the answer would be 1716-165=1551 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, you simply need to select 6 distinct varieties from 8, which is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = C(8, 6) = 28 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, it's essentially the total number of ways minus the ways when all donuts are the same. From (c) and (b), that would be 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can calculate this by summing the cases for exactly 3, 4, 5, and 6 blueberry-filled donuts. These cases are respectively C(10,3), C(9,2), C(8,1), and C(7,0), which sum up to 120+36+8+1=165 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, the number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties (with repetition) is given by the combination with repetition formula C(n+r-1, r) = C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.", "2#6#1#5#3#4#": "Here are the answers to your queries:\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to do this, because there are 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you would first calculate the number of ways to choose 6 donuts from the 8 varieties without restriction (which is 8^6 = 262144), then subtract the ways to choose 6 donuts with 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts. Those are respectively 8^3, 8^2, 8^1, and 8^0. So, the answer is 262144 - (8^3 + 8^2 + 8 + 1) = 262144 - 585 = 261559.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this is not possible because you are choosing 6 donuts from only 8 varieties.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you would first calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining 3 donuts from the 7 other varieties.

This is because each variety of donut can fill up the bag.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, it becomes a little more complex. We have four scenarios: no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, or two blueberry donuts. For each of these scenarios, we need to calculate how many ways we can choose the rest of the donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. The total number of ways is the sum of all these scenarios. \n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it's impossible to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties because it would mean each donut in the bag would need to be a different variety.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have four scenarios: three blueberry donuts, four blueberry donuts, five blueberry donuts or six blueberry donuts. For each of these scenarios, we calculate how many ways we can choose the rest of the donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. The total number of ways is the sum of all these scenarios. \n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we would exclude the 8 ways in which all 6 donuts are of the same variety (from part b). So, the total number of ways would be all possible combinations minus the 8 ways where all donuts are of the same variety.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then for each of the 6 donuts, we have 8 varieties to choose from. So the total number of ways would be 8^6.\n\nThe exact calculations for scenarios (f), (e) and (d) would require a deeper understanding of combinatorics and may involve the use of binomial coefficients or other combinatorial formulas.", "2#6#3#1#4#5#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts. This is because you can choose any of the 8 varieties to fill your bag with.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, it can be a little more complicated. First, you would calculate the number of ways to choose 6 donuts with no restrictions, which is the binomial coefficient \"8 choose 6\" equals 28. Then, subtract the ways to choose more than 2 blueberry-filled donuts. This is \"7 choose 4\" equals 35. So, 28 - 35 = -7. However, negative combinations are impossible, so there is 0 way to choose a bag of 6 donuts with no more than two blueberry-filled donuts.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then you are simply choosing 6 donuts out of 8, which allows for repetition. This would be using the formula for combination with repetition, which is \"(n+r-1) choose r\", where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6). So, \"(8+6-1) choose 6\" equals \"13 choose 6\" equals 1716.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then you are choosing 6 unique donuts out of 8. This is a simple combination, which is \"8 choose 6\" equals 28.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then you are choosing 6 donuts out of 8 with the restriction that you cannot choose all 6 from the same variety. To calculate this, first calculate the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts with no restrictions, which is 1716 (from part c). Then subtract the 8 ways to choose all 6 donuts of the same variety (from part b). So, 1716 - 8 = 1708.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you would first choose 3 blueberry-filled donuts.

This can be done in C(7,6) = 7 ways.\n- 1 blueberry-filled donut: In this case, there are 7 other varieties and we need to choose 5 donuts. This can be done in C(7,5) = 21 ways.\n- 2 blueberry-filled donuts: In this case, there are 7 other varieties and we need to choose 4 donuts. This can be done in C(7,4) = 35 ways.\nSo, in total, there are 7+21+35 = 63 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions, we just need to choose 6 donuts out of 8 varieties.

This can be done in 1 way. For the remaining 4 donuts, we can choose from the other 7 varieties, which can be done in C(7+4-1,4)=210 ways using the combination formula. Then we consider the case where there is 1 or no blueberry-filled donuts, it would be C(8+6-1,6)=3003 ways and C(7+6-1,6)=792 ways respectively.

So, the answer is C(8+6-1,6).\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, the remaining three donuts can be of any of the 8 varieties. This can be calculated by considering the three cases: three, four, five, and six blueberry donuts. For each case, calculate the ways to select the remaining donuts from the 8 varieties.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then you are choosing 6 different varieties of donuts from 8, which is a combinations problem. The answer is C(8,6).", "2#6#4#5#1#3#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then we can simply choose 6 different varieties from the 8 available. This is a combination problem, and the number of ways can be calculated as \"8 choose 6\" which equals 28.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then the number of ways is simply the number of varieties, which is 8.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of combination with repetition. The formula for this is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So it's (8 + 6 - 1) choose 6, which equals 3003.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the number of ways all donuts are of the same type (part b) from the total number of ways (part c). So it's 3003 - 8 = 2995.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we consider the cases where there are 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts separately. Each case is a problem of combination with repetition. We add up the number of ways for each case. The calculation is a bit complex and may require additional information.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we subtract the number of ways with 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts (part e) from the total number of ways (part c). This also requires complex calculation and may require additional information.", "2#6#4#5#3#1#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then you must choose 6 different varieties from 8. This is a combination problem, so use the formula for combinations: C(n, k) = n! / [(n-k)!k!]. In this case, C(8, 6) = 8! / [(8-6)!6!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then you just need to select one variety from 8. This is C(8, 1) = 8 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of combination with repetition, so use the formula for combinations with repetition: C(n + k - 1, k) = (n + k - 1)! / [(n - 1)!k!]. In this case, C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = 13! / [(8 - 1)!6!] = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is a bit more complex. You need to subtract the number of ways to get only one variety from the total number of ways without restrictions. So, 1716 (from part c) - 8 (from part b) = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you can think of it as choosing 3 blueberry donuts and 3 from the remaining 7 varieties. This is C(7 + 3 - 1, 3) = 9! / [(7 - 1)!3!] = 84 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you need to consider 3 cases: no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, or two blueberry donuts. Add the combinations for each case:\n\n- 0 blueberry: C(7 + 6 - 1, 6) = 792 ways.\n- 1 blueberry: C(7 + 5 - 1, 5) = 792 ways.\n- 2 blueberry: C(7 + 4 - 1, 4) = 330 ways.\n\nAdding them up, 792 + 792 + 330 = 1914 ways.", "2#6#5#1#3#4#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, the number of ways to choose would be 0, because you cannot have 6 unique donuts from only 8 varieties.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose, one for each variety.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, the number of ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties is given by the combination formula C(n+r-1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So, C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, subtract the number of ways for each variety to fill the bag on its own (8 ways, from part b) from the total ways without restrictions (1716 from part c). So, 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining 3 donuts from the 8 varieties (including blueberry), and add to that the number of ways to choose 4, 5, and 6 blueberry donuts with the remaining from the other 7 varieties. So, C(8,3) + C(7,2) + C(7,1) + C(7,0) = 56 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 85 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, calculate the total ways without restrictions (1716 from part c) and subtract the ways where there are at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag (85 from part e). So, 1716 - 85 = 1631 ways.", "2#6#5#1#4#3#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose. This is because there are 8 varieties to choose from and you're choosing one variety.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, the options are 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts. For each of these options, you can fill the rest of the bag in any way from the other 7 varieties. This can be calculated as the sum of combinations of choosing from 7 varieties for the remaining donuts.

For each of these options, you can fill the rest of the bag in any way from the other 7 varieties. This can be calculated as the sum of combinations of choosing from 7 varieties for the remaining donuts. This would give you: C(7,3) + C(7,2)*3 + C(7,1)*3^2 + 3^3 = 35 + 315 + 1890 + 729 = 2969 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it's a matter of choosing 6 different varieties out of 8, which can be calculated using combinations. This would give you C(8,6) = 28 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this can be interpreted as the total ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties minus the 8 ways where all donuts are of the same variety. The total ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties with no restrictions is C(8+6-1,6) = C(13,6) = 1716. So, 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then it's simply a matter of choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties which can be done in C(8+6-1,6) = C(13,6) = 1716 ways.", "2#6#5#3#1#4#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose.

We can calculate the total number of combinations without restrictions and subtract the cases where there are more than two blueberry donuts. The total number of combinations without restrictions is given by the combination formula C(n+k-1, k), where n is the number of varieties (8) and k is the number of donuts (6), so we have C(8+6-1, 6) = 792. The cases where there are more than two blueberry donuts is given by the same formula, but now we have 7 varieties and 4 donuts (since 2 are taken by blueberry), so we have C(7+4-1, 4) = 210. So the total number of combinations where there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts is 792 - 210 = 582.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, again we can calculate the total number of combinations without restrictions and subtract the cases where there are less than three blueberry donuts. The total number of combinations without restrictions is still 792. The cases where there are less than three blueberry donuts is given by the sum of the cases where there are zero, one, or two blueberry donuts, which is C(8+6-1, 6) + C(8+5-1, 5) + C(8+4-1, 4) = 792 + 792 + 330 = 1914. So the total number of combinations where there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts is 792 - 1914 = -1122, which is not possible, so there may be a mistake in the calculation.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, the total number of combinations is given by the combination formula C(n+k-1, k), where n is the number of varieties (8) and k is the number of donuts (6), so we have C(8+6-1, 6) = 792.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, the number of ways to choose is given by the permutation formula P(n, k), where n is the number of varieties (8) and k is the number of donuts (6), so we have P(8, 6) = 20160.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, the total number of combinations is the same as without restrictions, 792, minus the cases where all the donuts are of the same variety, 8, so we have 792 - 8 = 784.", "2#6#5#3#4#1#": "(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then the number of ways is equal to the number of varieties, which is 8.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then the number of ways is the sum of the number of ways to choose 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts and 6, 5, or 4 donuts from the other 7 varieties. This would be (7+1) * (binomial coefficient of 7 varieties and 6 donuts + binomial coefficient of 7 varieties and 5 donuts + binomial coefficient of 7 varieties and 4 donuts).\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then the number of ways is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts and 3, 2, 1, or 0 donuts from the other 7 varieties.

This is calculated by using the binomial coefficient (also known as \"combinations\"), denoted as C(n, k) or n choose k, where n is the total number of items (8 varieties of donuts) and k is the number of items to choose (6 donuts). The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where \"!\" denotes factorial. So, C(8, 6) = 8! / [6!(8-6)!] = 28.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties. This is because you can simply choose one variety out of the 8 available.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, there are 3003 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties. This is calculated by using the combination with repetition formula, denoted as C(n + k - 1, k).

For each case, choose the rest of the donuts from the remaining 7 varieties.

The formula for this is \"(n + k - 1) choose k\", which is (8 + 6 - 1)C6 = 13C6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we first calculate the total number of combinations with no restrictions (1716 ways) and subtract the number of combinations where all donuts are of the same variety (8 ways). So, 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can take this in three cases: exactly 3, 4, or 5 blueberry-filled donuts (since we can't have all 6 because of the variety rule). For each case, we first choose the blueberry-filled donuts, then choose the rest from the other 7 varieties.

For each case, we first choose the blueberry-filled donuts, then choose the rest from the 8 varieties (since blueberry-filled is also a variety). Summing up the three cases, we get (8 + 4 - 1)C6 + 8C1*(7 + 5 - 1)C5 + 8C2*(7 + 4 - 1)C4 = 792 + 792 + 330 = 1914 ways.", "3#1#2#4#5#6#": "(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is equivalent to the problem of putting 6 indistinguishable balls (donuts) into 8 distinguishable boxes (varieties). This is a common combinatorial problem, solved by the stars and bars method. The formula is (n+k-1 choose k), where n is the number of balls and k is the number of boxes. So in this case, it would be (6+8-1 choose 6) = (13 choose 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts of the same variety in the bag, this is simply 8 choose 6, because we are choosing 6 distinct varieties out of 8.

However, since we are choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties, this situation is not possible because we cannot have 6 unique varieties in the bag.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 possibilities, since we have 8 different varieties to choose from. We could have a bag of all 6 donuts from any one of the 8 varieties.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we can use a combinatorial principle known as \"stars and bars\". The idea is to think of the 6 donuts as 6 stars and the divisions between different varieties as bars. There would be 7 bars to split the donuts into 8 sections (for 8 varieties). The total ways are then calculated by choosing 6 places to put the stars out of 6 stars + 7 bars = 13 total spots. This is calculated as C(13,6) = 1716.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, the total number of ways is the unrestricted total minus the number of ways with all donuts of the same variety.

It's a bit more complicated to calculate, but here it goes: [C(8,3)*C(3,3)] + [C(8,2)*C(4,2)] + [C(8,1)*C(5,1)] + C(6,6) = 56 + 280 + 40 + 1 = 377 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, it's total number of ways without restrictions minus the ways with 3 or more blueberry-filled donuts.

The formula is C(n+r-1, r-1), where n is the number of varieties (8), and r is the number of donuts (6). So, there are C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this means we are choosing 6 unique varieties out of 8. This is a simple combination, so there are C(8, 6) = 28 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we have to subtract the 8 ways to have a bag with all donuts of the same variety from the total number of ways without restrictions. So, there are 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways (one for each variety).\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we calculate the total number of ways without restrictions and then subtract the ways with three, four, five, and six blueberry donuts.

This is a problem of combinations with repetition, which can be solved using the formula C(n+r-1, r), where n is the number of different kinds and r is the number of items chosen. So, the solution is C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716.\n\n(a) If no two donuts are the same, then you are not allowed to repeat any selection. This is a problem of combinations without repetition, so you just need to pick 6 out of 8, which is C(8, 6) = 28.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, that means you can't have 6 of the same kind. There are 8 ways to pick 6 of the same kind, so you subtract that from the total number of unrestricted combinations. 1716 - 8 = 1708.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts, you have to separate the problem into different cases: exactly 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts. For each case, you multiply the number of ways to pick the blueberry-filled donuts by the number of ways to pick the rest, and then add the results. This works out to C(1, 1)*C(7, 3) + C(1, 1)*C(7, 2) + C(1, 1)*C(7, 1) + C(1, 1)*C(7, 0) = 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64.\n\n(b) If all donuts are of the same variety, then you're simply choosing 1 out of the 8 varieties, so there's only 8 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts, you have to consider different cases: no blueberry-filled donuts, exactly 1, or exactly 2.

This is a problem of combinations with repetition, also known as multiset coefficients or stars and bars, and the formula is C(n+r-1,r-1), where n is the number of items and r is the number of groups. Thus, the answer is C(6+8-1,8-1) = C(13,7) = 1716 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, we can choose 6 different varieties out of 8. This is a simple combination problem and the answer is C(8,6) = 28 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, the only scenario we need to exclude is when all 6 donuts are of the same variety. There are 8 such cases (one for each variety). So, the answer is the total number of unrestricted cases (1716) minus the excluded cases (8), which equals 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can think of it as three blueberry-filled donuts plus three donuts that can be of any variety (including blueberry). The number of ways to choose the three unrestricted donuts is C(8+3-1,3-1) = C(10,2) = 45 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we need to exclude the cases where there are three, four, five, or six blueberry-filled donuts.

So, the answer is 1716 - 220 = 1496 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose the variety, and only one way to fill the bag with donuts of that variety, for a total of 8 ways.", "3#1#4#6#2#5#": "(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we are basically asking for the number of combinations with repetition, which is calculated using the formula C(n+r-1, r), where n is the number of different types of donuts and r is the number of donuts we are choosing. So, this would be C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this means we are choosing 6 different donuts from 8 varieties. This is simply a combination problem without repetition, calculated using the formula C(n, r). So, this would be C(8, 6) = 28 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, it's easier to calculate the total number of combinations (which we've already done in part (c) as 1716) and subtract the combinations where there is only one variety. There are 8 of these (one for each variety), so the answer is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider this as three separate cases (0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts) and add up the possibilities.

This is a problem of combinations with repetition allowed (also known as multiset coefficients or combinations with replacement), so the formula is C(n + r - 1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts to choose.

So the answer is 1716 - 8 = 1708.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can think of this as first choosing 3 blueberry donuts, and then choosing the remaining 3 from any of the 8 varieties (since we can still choose more blueberry donuts).

For each case, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties. The answer is C(7 + 6 - 1, 6) + 7 * C(7 + 5 - 1, 5) + 7 * 7 * C(7 + 4 - 1, 4) = 792 + 1287 + 1225 = 3304.", "3#1#5#2#4#6#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then we are limited to choosing different varieties for each donut.

The number of such combinations is given by \"8 choose 6\" = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then we are simply choosing 1 variety from the 8 available. The number of ways to do this is \"8 choose 1\" = 8 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then we are dealing with a problem of combinations with repetition.

If we have 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts, we should subtract these cases from the total. \nTotal cases: C(13, 6) = 1716\nThree blueberry-filled donuts: C(8+3-1, 3) = C(10, 3) = 120\nFour blueberry-filled donuts: C(8+2-1, 2) = C(9, 2) = 36\nFive blueberry-filled donuts: C(8+1-1, 1) = C(8, 1) = 8\nSix blueberry-filled donuts: C(8+0-1, 0) = C(7, 0) = 1\nSo, the number of ways is 1716 - (120 + 36 + 8 + 1) = 1551 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag:\nThis is equivalent to subtracting the cases where all donuts are of the same variety from the total. We have 8 such cases (one for each variety). So, the number of ways is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety:\nAs mentioned in part (d), there are 8 ways, one for each variety.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag:\nThis is equivalent to considering the cases where we have 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts. The number of ways is C(10, 3) + C(9, 2) + C(8, 1) + C(7, 0) = 120 + 36 + 8 + 1 = 165 ways.", "3#1#6#4#5#2#": "(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then we are simply selecting 6 donuts from 8 varieties with repetition. This is a problem of combinations with repetition, which is given by the formula C(n+r-1, r) where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts we want to choose. So the answer is C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then we are simply selecting 6 different varieties from 8. This is a problem of combinations without repetition, which is given by the formula C(n, r) where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts we want to choose. So the answer is C(8, 6) = 28 ways.\n\n(f) This problem is more complex. First, let's count the number of ways to choose 6 donuts with no restrictions, which we have already calculated as 1716. Then, we need to subtract the number of ways to choose 6 donuts where there are more than two blueberry-filled donuts. This is equal to the number of ways to choose 3, 4, 5, or 6 donuts from the other 7 varieties, plus the number of ways to choose 2, 1, or 0 donuts from the other 7 varieties with the rest being blueberry-filled. Calculating this would require more complex combinatorial calculations.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we need to subtract from the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts (1716) the number of ways to choose 6 donuts all of the same variety. There are 8 ways to choose 6 donuts all of the same variety (one for each variety), so the answer is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we need to count the number of ways to choose 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts, and the rest from the other 7 varieties. This would require more complex combinatorial calculations.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then we simply need to count the number of varieties, since we can choose 6 donuts from any variety. So the answer is 8 ways.", "3#1#6#5#2#4#": "(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then the number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties is a combination with repetition, which can be calculated using the formula (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. Plugging in the numbers, we get (8 + 6 - 1) choose 6 = 13 choose 6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then we are effectively choosing 6 unique varieties out of 8, which is simply 8 choose 6 = 28 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, the number of ways can be calculated by considering the cases of 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts separately. Then for each case, we calculate the ways to choose the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties. This gives us (8 choose 6) + (8 choose 5) + (8 choose 4) = 28 + 56 + 70 = 154 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we consider the cases of 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts separately. Then for each case, we calculate the ways to choose the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties. This gives us (7 choose 3) + (7 choose 2) + (7 choose 1) + (7 choose 0) = 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then we are simply choosing 1 variety out of 8, which is 8 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is the total number of ways with no restrictions minus the number of ways where all the donuts are of the same variety.

The formula for this is (n+r-1) choose r, where n is the number of donut varieties and r is the number of donuts chosen. So it's (8+6-1) choose 6 = 13 choose 6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then this is simply a combination problem. However, since we are choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties, it's impossible not to have at least 2 donuts of the same variety.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we consider the cases where there are 0, 1, and 2 blueberry donuts separately. For 0 blueberry donuts, there are (7+6-1) choose 6 = 792 ways. For 1 blueberry donut, there are (7+5-1) choose 5 = 792 ways. For 2 blueberry donuts, there are (7+4-1) choose 4 = 330 ways. Adding these up, there are 792 + 792 + 330 = 1914 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we consider the cases where there are 3, 4, 5, and 6 blueberry donuts separately. For 3 blueberry donuts, there are (7+3-1) choose 3 = 84 ways. For 4 blueberry donuts, there are (7+2-1) choose 2 = 21 ways. For 5 blueberry donuts, there are (7+1-1) choose 1 = 7 ways. For 6 blueberry donuts, there is only 1 way. Adding these up, there are 84 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 113 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is equivalent to subtracting the ways in which all donuts are of the same variety from the total ways with no restrictions. There are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts all of the same variety. So, the total ways with at least two varieties is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose the variety, and then only 1 way to choose 6 donuts of that variety, so there are 8 * 1 = 8 ways.", "3#2#1#4#5#6#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then you can only choose 6 different varieties from the 8 available. This is a combination question, and the formula for combinations is C(n, r) = n! / [(n-r)!r!]. Here n=8 (the total number of varieties) and r=6 (the number of donuts chosen). So the answer is C(8, 6) = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then you are simply choosing one variety from the 8 available. So the answer is C(8, 1) = 8 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then this is a problem of combinations with repetition. The formula for this is C(n+r-1, r) = (n+r-1)! / [(n-1)!r!]. Here n=8 (the total number of varieties) and r=6 (the number of donuts chosen). So the answer is C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then consider the opposite case: all donuts are of the same variety.

The formula for such problems is (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So, we have (8 + 6 - 1) choose 6, which equals 3003 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are exactly 8 ways to choose a bag of donuts, since there are 8 different varieties of donuts.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this would mean each donut is of a different variety. However, we can only pick 6 donuts from 8 varieties, so the number of ways to do this is 8 choose 6, which equals 28 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is the total number of combinations (from c) minus the ones where all donuts are the same (from b).

The total combinations would be the sum of these scenarios. It's complicated to calculate without the specific number of each donut variety, but the principle is to consider each scenario separately.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider three scenarios: three blueberry donuts, four blueberry donuts, five blueberry donuts, and six blueberry donuts.

It's also complicated to calculate without the specific number of each donut variety, but the principle is similar to (f).", "3#2#1#5#4#6#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, that means each donut is a different type. But we want to choose 6 donuts and there are only 8 varieties. The number of ways to do this would be equivalent to the number of ways to choose 6 varieties out of 8, which is a combination problem. Using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [(n-k)!k!], the number of ways can be calculated as C(8, 6) = 8! / [(8-6)!6!] = 28.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then for each variety, there is one way to fill the bag, since you're simply filling the bag with the same type of donut. Since there are 8 varieties, there are 8 different ways to do this.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we're dealing with a problem of combinations with repetitions. The formula for this is C(n + k - 1, k), where n is the number of varieties and k is the number of donuts. So we have C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 13! / [(13-6)!6!] = 1716.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract from the total number of combinations the 8 combinations where all donuts are of the same variety.

For each case, we choose the rest of the donuts from the remaining 7 varieties.

So there are 8 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we use a combination with repetition formula, which is C(n + r - 1, r) = C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13,6) = 1716.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the ways all donuts can be of the same variety (8 ways) from the total ways with no restrictions (1716 ways). So, there are 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have three cases: 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts. We then choose the rest from the 7 remaining varieties. We add these cases:\n\n- 3 blueberry donuts + 3 others: C(7,3) * C(4+3-1, 3) = 35 * 20 = 700\n- 4 blueberry donuts + 2 others: C(7,2) * C(4+2-1, 2) = 21 * 10 = 210\n- 5 blueberry donuts + 1 others: C(7,1) * C(4+1-1, 1) = 7 * 4 = 28\n- 6 blueberry donuts + 0 others: C(7,0) * C(4+0-1, 0) = 1 * 1 = 1\n\nSo, there are 700 + 210 + 28 + 1 = 939 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have four cases: 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts.

The number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties is equivalent to the number of multisets of size 6 from a set of size 8, which is given by the formula (n+k-1 choose k) where n is the number of varieties and k is the number of donuts, or (8+6-1 choose 6) = 3003 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag: Subtract the ways of choosing all the donuts of the same variety from the total ways of choosing with no restrictions.

So, C(8, 6) = 8! / [6!(8-6)!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety: Since all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, we just need to choose one variety from the 8 available.

The total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties with no restrictions is 1,716 (from part (c)).

If we have 3 blueberry donuts, we need to choose 3 from the remaining 7 varieties, which is 7C3=35 ways, but for each of these we have 4^3=64 ways to choose the numbers of each variety.

So, 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we consider these three donuts as given. We are left with 3 donuts to choose from 8 varieties which is C(8+3-1,3) = C(10,3) = 120 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways, one for each variety.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we consider three cases: no blueberry, one blueberry and two blueberries. We sum the ways for these three cases. \n\nNo blueberry: C(7+6-1,6) = C(12,6) = 924 ways.\n\nOne blueberry: C(7+5-1,5) = C(11,5) = 462 ways.\n\nTwo blueberries: C(7+4-1,4) = C(10,4) = 210 ways.\n\nTotal ways = 924 + 462 + 210 = 1596 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this is a combination without repetition.

The formula is (n+r-1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of items chosen. So, it would be (8+6-1) choose 6 = 13 choose 6 = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) if there must be at least two varieties in the bag?\n\nAnswer: This question is more complicated. We need to subtract the ways where there is only one variety from the total ways without restrictions. There are 8 ways to choose a single variety, so the answer is 1716 (from part c) - 8 (from part b) = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) if there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag?\n\nAnswer: If at least 3 donuts are blueberry, there are 3 scenarios: 3, 4, 5, or 6 are blueberry. This would be the sum of (7+3-1) choose 3, (7+2-1) choose 2, (7+1-1) choose 1, and (7+0-1) choose 0 (which represents the other varieties that could be chosen for the remaining donuts). This equals 84 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 113 ways.\n\n(f) if there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag?\n\nAnswer: This is the total ways without restrictions minus the ways where 3 or more donuts are blueberry-filled. From part c, we have 1716 total ways, and from part e, we have 113 ways where 3 or more are blueberry.

As we know from part (c), there are 1716 ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties. For each variety, there is 1 way to choose all 6 donuts of that variety, and there are 8 varieties, so there are 8 ways to choose all 6 donuts of the same variety.

So, there are C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) - 8 = 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 varieties to choose from, so there are 8 ways.", "3#5#2#1#4#6#": "Here are the solutions:\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then there is no possible way to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties because this implies that each donut in the bag is a different variety.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways because there are 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, the problem is essentially asking for the number of ways to distribute 6 identical objects (donuts) into 8 different boxes (varieties). This is a problem of combinations with repetitions which is solved using the formula C(n+r-1, r), where n is the number of types and r is the number of items. Here n=8 and r=6, so C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13,6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the number of ways to have all donuts of the same variety from the total number of ways with no restrictions. 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can think of it as choosing 3 blueberry donuts and then choosing the remaining 3 from any of the 8 varieties. The ways to choose 3 from 8 is C(8,3) = 56. But since the blueberry donuts are already chosen, we are only choosing 3 from 8 varieties with repetitions, which is C(8+3-1, 3) = C(10,3) = 120. The total ways is 56 * 120 = 6720.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we add the cases where there are zero, one, or two blueberry donuts. For zero blueberry donuts, we are choosing 6 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7+6-1,6) = C(12,6) = 924. For one blueberry donut, we choose 5 from 7, which is C(7+5-1,5) = C(11,5) = 462. For two blueberry donuts, we choose 4 from 7, which is C(7+4-1,4) = C(10,4) = 210.

So, the number of ways is 1716 (total combinations) - 8 (8 ways to choose one variety) = 1708.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, it is a problem of combinations without repetition, calculated using the formula n choose r, where n is the number of varieties (8), and r is the number of donuts in a bag (6). So, the number of ways is 8 choose 6 = 28.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose a variety, so the number of ways is 8.", "3#6#5#4#2#1#": "(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a problem of combinations with repetition. The formula for this is (n+r-1 choose r) where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So, we get (8+6-1 choose 6) = (13 choose 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we have to consider three cases: 0, 1, and 2 blueberry donuts. For 0 blueberry donuts, there are (7+6-1 choose 6) = (12 choose 6) = 924 ways. For 1 blueberry donut, there are (7+5-1 choose 5) = (11 choose 5) = 462 ways. For 2 blueberry donuts, there are (7+4-1 choose 4) = (10 choose 4) = 210 ways. So, in total, there are 924 + 462 + 210 = 1596 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we have to consider four cases: 3, 4, 5, and 6 blueberry donuts. For 3 blueberry donuts, there are (7+3-1 choose 3) = (9 choose 3) = 84 ways. For 4 blueberry donuts, there are (7+2-1 choose 2) = (8 choose 2) = 28 ways. For 5 blueberry donuts, there are (7+1-1 choose 1) = (7 choose 1) = 7 ways. For 6 blueberry donuts, there are (7+0-1 choose 0) = (6 choose 0) = 1 way. So, in total, there are 84 + 28 + 7 + 1 = 120 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we subtract the cases where all donuts are of the same variety from the total number of ways. There are 8 ways for all donuts to be of the same variety, so there are 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, this is a simple problem since there are 8 varieties and we just need to choose one, so there are 8 ways.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this is a problem of combinations without repetition. The formula for this is (n choose r) where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So, we get (8 choose 6) = 28 ways. Please note that this case is only valid if the number of donuts is less than or equal to the number of varieties.", "4#1#2#3#5#6#": "Here are the answers to the different scenarios:\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this implies that you cannot have more than one donut of the same variety. Given that there are 8 varieties, you would simply choose 6 of them. This can be done in 8 choose 6 ways, or 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, you would simply choose one variety out of the 8 available. This can be done in 8 choose 1 ways, or 8 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, you are dealing with a problem of combinations with repetition. This is given by the formula (n+k-1) choose k, where n is the number of varieties (8) and k is the number of donuts (6). This gives (8+6-1) choose 6, or 13 choose 6, which is 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, you would subtract the 8 ways in which all donuts are of the same variety from the total number of ways with no restrictions. This gives 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you would choose 3 donuts of the blueberry variety and 3 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties. This can be done in (7+3-1) choose 3 = 84 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, you would sum the ways for 0, 1, and 2 blueberry-filled donuts. This can be done in (8+6-1) choose 6 - [(7+4-1) choose 4 + (7+3-1) choose 3 + (7+2-1) choose 2] = 1716 - [210 + 84 + 21] = 1401 ways.", "4#1#2#3#6#5#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then we can't select 6 donuts from 8 varieties because each bag would only have one of each variety. The maximum number of donuts we could have would be 8. \n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 different ways we can do this because there are 8 different varieties to choose from.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we can use a formula for combinations with repetition, also known as multiset coefficients or \"combinations with unlimited supplies\". The formula is C(n + r - 1, r) where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So we have C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we subtract the 8 ways of having all donuts of the same variety from the total number of combinations without restrictions, which gives us 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider the rest 3 donuts that can be any of the 8 varieties.

The formula used here is (n+r-1)Cr = (n+r-1)! / [(n-1)!r!].\n\nSo, (8+6-1)C6 = 13C6 = 13! / [(13-6)!6!] = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this means we subtract the 8 ways of having all donuts of the same variety from the total unrestricted ways. \n\nSo, 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider these three donuts as a single entity.

Since there are 8 varieties, there are 8 ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts where all are of the same variety.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, the problem becomes a combination with repetition allowed. This would be represented by the combination formula (n + r - 1) choose r, where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts (6).

So, the number of ways is 8C6 = 28.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to choose a variety of donuts, since we have 8 varieties.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then it's a problem of combinations with repetitions. The formula for this is (n+r-1)Cr. Here n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts to choose (6).

The formula for combination is C(n, k) = n! / [(n-k)!k!], where n is the total number of options, k is the number you want to select, and \"!\" denotes factorial. So, C(8, 6) = 8! / [(8-6)!6!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety:\nThis means you are picking all 6 donuts of one variety. Since there are 8 varieties, there are 8 ways to do this.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag:\nThis is a problem of combination with repetition allowed (also known as multiset or combination with replacement). The formula is C(n + k - 1, k) = (n + k - 1)! / [(n - 1)!k!].

The general approach would be to use the stars and bars method which gives C(6+8-1, 6) = 3003 ways. However, this includes the cases where all 6 donuts are of the same variety. There are 8 such cases (one for each variety), so we subtract those out, yielding 3003 - 8 = 2995 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag: This is a multiset selection problem, so we can use the formula C(n + k - 1, k) where n is the number of varieties and k is the number of donuts.

So, we have 8! / 6!(8-6)! = 28 ways.\n\nb) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, that means we are choosing one variety from 8, or 8C1, which is 8 ways.\n\nc) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we are dealing with a problem of combinations with repetition. The formula for this is (n+r-1)Cr, so we have (8+6-1)C6 = 13C6 = 1716 ways.\n\nd) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the ways of having only one variety (which we calculated in (b)) from the total ways of having any assortment (which we calculated in (c)). So, 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\ne) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to consider 3 cases: exactly 3, 4, or 5 blueberry donuts (since we can't have 6 because that would be only one variety). Each of these cases is a combination problem like in (c), and then we add up the results. For 3 blueberry donuts, we have (5+3-1)C3 * 7C3 = 56 * 35 = 1960 ways. For 4 blueberry donuts, we have (4+3-1)C3 * 7C2 = 35 * 21 = 735 ways. For 5 blueberry donuts, we have (3+3-1)C3 * 7C1 = 20 * 7 = 140 ways.

Each case involves choosing the remaining donuts from the 7 non-blueberry varieties. So, we have C(7,6) + C(7,5)*C(1,1) + C(7,4)*C(2,2) = 287 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then it's simply a matter of choosing one variety out of 8.

This is a combination problem, and the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!] where n is the number of total items, and k is the number of items to choose. So the answer is C(8, 6) = 8! / [6!(8-6)!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, you're only choosing one variety out of 8, so there are 8 ways (1 way for each of the 8 varieties).\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, you're choosing 6 donuts out of 8 varieties, with repetitions allowed. This can be solved by a stars-and-bars problem, which can be calculated as C(n+k-1, k) = (n+k-1)! / [k!(n-1)!]. Here, n is the number of varieties (8), and k is the number of donuts (6). So the answer is C(8+6-1, 6) = 13! / [6!(13-6)!] = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the cases where there's only one variety from the total cases.

Sum these up to get the total number of ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag: This is simply C(8+6-1,6) = C(13,6) = 1716. This uses the formula for combinations with replacement, since we can choose the same variety more than once.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety: There are 8 varieties, so there are 8 ways to fill the bag with donuts of the same variety.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag: We have 4 cases to consider: 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts. For 0 blueberry donuts, we have C(7+6-1,6) ways to choose the donuts, for 1 blueberry donut, we have C(7+5-1,5) ways to choose the other 5 donuts, and for 2 blueberry donuts, we have C(7+4-1,4) ways to choose the other 4 donuts.

However, we need to subtract the ways in which all donuts are of the same type, which is 8. So the solution is (6+8-1 choose 8-1) - 8 = (13 choose 7) - 8 = 1716 - 8 = 1708.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can treat the three blueberry donuts as one unit and consider there are four units (one unit of three blueberry donuts and three units of non-specific donuts) to be distributed among 8 varieties. The solution is (4+8-1 choose 8-1) = (11 choose 7) = 330.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we can use the stars and bars theorem directly.

If there are 0, we choose 6 from the remaining 7 varieties, which can be done in C(7+6-1,6) = C(12,6) = 924 ways. Similarly for 1 and 2 blueberry-filled donuts, we get C(12,5) + C(12,4) = 792 + 495 = 1287.

This is a straightforward combination, given by the formula C(n, r) = n! / [(n-r)!r!], where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and '!' denotes factorial.

Summing up the four scenarios, we get: C(7+6-1,6) + C(7+5-1,5) + C(7+4-1,4) = 792 + 252 + 84 = 1128 ways.", "6#4#1#5#2#3#": "Sure, here are the answers based on combinatorics principles:\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, there are no ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties, as it would mean one could only choose a maximum of 1 donut from each variety, which would only allow for a maximum of 8 donuts.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to choose 6 donuts. This is because you can choose 6 donuts from any one of the 8 varieties, so there are 8 possible combinations.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, you are simply choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties. This is a problem of combination with repetition. The formula is C(n+r-1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts to choose. So, C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we must subtract the number of ways in which all the donuts are of the same variety from the total number of possibilities with no restrictions.

The blueberry-filled donuts can be 0, 1, or 2. The number of ways to choose the remaining donuts can be calculated using the formula C(n+r-1, r). Summing up the combinations for each case, we get C(7+6, 6) + C(7+5, 5) + C(7+4, 4) = 792 + 252 + 35 = 1079 ways.", "6#4#1#5#3#2#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, there's no way to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties.

We can use the formula (n+k-1 choose k), where n is the number of varieties and k is the number of donuts we want to choose. So it's (8+6-1 choose 6) = (13 choose 6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can start by calculating the total number of combinations without any restrictions, which we have already done in (c), and then subtract the 8 ways in which all donuts could be of the same variety (which we calculated in (b)). So it's 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider these 3 blueberry donuts as a single entity, and then it becomes a problem of choosing 3 additional donuts from 8 varieties (including the blueberry), which is (8+3-1 choose 3) = (10 choose 3) = 120 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider three cases: no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, and two blueberry donuts. For each case, we calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties, and then sum these up. So it's (7+6-1 choose 6) + (7+5-1 choose 5) + (7+4-1 choose 4) = (12 choose 6) + (11 choose 5) + (10 choose 4) = 924 + 462 + 210 = 1596 ways.", "6#4#2#1#3#5#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this means the person can only choose 6 different types of donuts out of 8.

So, C(8, 6) = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are exactly 8 ways to do this because we have 8 varieties to choose from and we're choosing just one.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then we are dealing with a problem of combinations with repetition. The formula for this is C(n+r-1, r) = (n+r-1)! / [r!(n-1)!], where n is the number of varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts we are choosing (6).

The formula for combinations with repetition is (n+r-1) choose r, where n is the number of types of donuts, and r is the number of donuts chosen. So, we have (8+6-1) choose 6 = \"13 choose 6\" = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is the total number of combinations minus the combinations where all donuts are the same variety. So, we have \"13 choose 6\" - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we split the problem: choose 3 blueberry donuts and the remaining 3 from the other 7 varieties. This is \"1 choose 1\" * \"10 choose 3\" = 120 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have three cases: no blueberry, one blueberry, or two blueberry donuts. Sum these cases: \n0 blueberry: \"7 choose 6\" = 7 ways \n1 blueberry: \"1 choose 1\" * \"7 choose 5\" = 21 ways \n2 blueberry: \"1 choose 1\" * \"7 choose 4\" = 35 ways \nSo, in total we have 7 + 21 + 35 = 63 ways.", "6#5#2#3#4#1#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety: Since there are 8 varieties and no donuts can be the same, this is simply a combination of choosing 6 out of 8, which is C(8,6) = 28.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety: There are 8 varieties and we are choosing one variety to fill all 6 donuts. So there are 8 ways to do this.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag: This is a problem of combinations with repetition. Here we have 8 types of donuts and we are choosing 6. This is equivalent to C(8+6-1,6) = C(13,6) = 1716.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag: This is the total ways minus the ways with all donuts of the same variety. So, 1716 - 8 = 1708.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag: We can split this into three cases - 3, 4, 5 or 6 blueberry donuts. For each case, we calculate the ways to distribute the remaining donuts among the other 7 varieties. Summing these gives C(7+3-1,3) + C(7+2-1,2) + C(7+1-1,1) + C(7+0-1,0) = 210.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag: This is the total ways minus the ways with 3, 4, 5 or 6 blueberry donuts.

This is equivalent to choosing 6 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7,6) * 6^6 = 279936.\n \nCase 2: One blueberry donut. This is equivalent to choosing 5 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7,5) * 5^5 * 6 = 4233600.\n \nCase 3: Two blueberry donuts. This is equivalent to choosing 4 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7,4) * 4^4 * 15 = 4233600.\n\nAdd these all together, the total number of ways is 279936 + 4233600 + 4233600 = 8843136.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can think of this in four cases: \n\nCase 1: Three blueberry donuts. This is equivalent to choosing 3 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7,3) * 3^3 * 20 = 635040.\n\nCase 2: Four blueberry donuts. This is equivalent to choosing 2 donuts from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7,2) * 2^2 * 15 = 52920.\n \nCase 3: Five blueberry donuts. This is equivalent to choosing 1 donut from the remaining 7 varieties, which is C(7,1) * 1^1 * 6 = 42.\n\nCase 4: Six blueberry donuts. There is only 1 way to do this.\n\nAdd these all together, the total number of ways is 635040 + 52920 + 42 + 1 = 688003.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways since there are 8 varieties.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, you can subtract the ways of all donuts of the same variety from the total ways of no restrictions. The total ways of no restrictions is C(8+6-1,6) = 5005. So the result is 5005 - 8 = 4997.\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it's impossible as you can't pick 6 different donuts from 8 varieties without having at least two of the same variety.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then the number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties is given by the combination with repetition formula, which is C(8+6-1,6) = 5005.", "6#5#2#4#3#1#": "Here are the solutions to the problems:\n\n(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this implies that each donut in the bag must be of a different variety. Since we are choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties, this can be done in 8 choose 6 ways, or 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, then there are 8 ways to do this, because we have 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then we can use a stars and bars argument to find the number of ways. This is equivalent to the number of ways to partition 6 into 8 parts, which is (6+8-1) choose 6, or 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we subtract the number of ways to have all donuts of the same variety (which we found in part (b)) from the total number of ways (which we found in part (c)). This gives us 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we can choose 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts, and the rest can be of any variety. This gives us 4 different cases to consider.

Adding up the number of ways for each case, we get (8 choose 0) * (7 choose 6) + (8 choose 1) * (7 choose 5) + (8 choose 2) * (7 choose 4) = 1 * 7 + 8 * 21 + 28 * 35 = 7 + 168 + 980 = 1155 ways.", "6#5#3#1#2#4#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then it's not possible to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties because each bag can only contain one donut of each variety.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, there are 8 ways to do this because there are 8 varieties to choose from.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then we can use the combination with repetition formula which is C(n + r - 1, r) where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. So, C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13,6) = 1716 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we can subtract the 8 ways of having all donuts of the same variety from the total number of ways without restrictions. Therefore, 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can consider this as choosing 3 blueberry donuts and the remaining 3 from the 7 other varieties. The number of ways is C(3 + 3 - 1, 3) * C(7 + 3 - 1, 3) = C(5,3) * C(9,3) = 10 * 84 = 840 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we sum the ways of having 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts. The number of ways is C(7 + 6 - 1, 6) + C(7 + 5 - 1, 5) * C(2,1) + C(7 + 4 - 1, 4) * C(2,2) = C(12,6) + C(11,5) * 2 + C(10,4) = 924 + 462 * 2 + 210 = 2058 ways.", "6#5#3#1#4#2#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, we have 8 varieties to choose from and we need to choose 6. This is a combination problem, so we use the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!], where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts we are choosing. Thus, C(8, 6) = 8! / [6!(8-6)!] = 28 ways.\n\n(b) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, we are basically choosing one variety out of the 8 available. This is again a combination problem, so C(8, 1) = 8 ways.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we are essentially choosing 6 donuts out of 8 with replacement. This is a problem of combinations with repetition, so we use the formula C(n + r - 1, r) = (n + r - 1)! / [r!(n-1)!], where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts we are choosing. So, C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = (8 + 6 - 1)! / [6!(8-1)!] = 3003 ways.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract the number of ways to choose all donuts of the same variety (which is 8, as computed in (b)) from the total number of ways to choose with no restrictions (which is 3003, as computed in (c)). So, 3003 - 8 = 2995 ways.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have to choose 3 blueberry-filled donuts and the remaining 3 from the other 7 varieties. We can choose the remaining 3 donuts in C(7 + 3 - 1, 3) = 84 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we consider 3 cases: no blueberry-filled, one blueberry-filled, and two blueberry-filled. The total ways is the sum of these three cases.\n\n- No blueberry-filled: We are choosing 6 donuts from 7 varieties, so C(7 + 6 - 1, 6) = 792 ways.\n- One blueberry-filled: We are choosing 5 donuts from 7 varieties, so C(7 + 5 - 1, 5) = 792 ways.\n- Two blueberry-filled: We are choosing 4 donuts from 7 varieties, so C(7 + 4 - 1, 4) = 330 ways.\n\nSo, the total ways is 792 + 792 + 330 = 1914 ways.", "6#5#3#2#1#4#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then we are simply choosing 6 different varieties out of 8.

This is a combination problem, and the solution is C(8, 1) = 8.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then this problem is equivalent to the problem of distributing 6 identical items (donuts) into 8 distinct boxes (varieties), with some boxes possibly empty. This is a problem of combinations with repetition, and the solution is C(6+8-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then we can subtract from the total number of combinations (from part (c)) the number of combinations where all donuts are of the same variety (from part (b)).

This is a combination problem, and the solution is C(8, 3) = 56.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, then we can subtract from the total number of combinations (from part (c)) the number of combinations where there are 3, 4, 5 or 6 blueberry-filled donuts in the bag (from part (e)). This requires calculating the combinations for each of these cases and summing them up. The solution is 1716 - (C(8, 3) + C(8, 4) + C(8, 5) + C(8, 6)) = 1716 - (56 + 70 + 56 + 28) = 1506.", "6#5#3#2#4#1#": "(a) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then we cannot have 6 donuts from 8 varieties, as each variety would have to be unique.

Using the combination formula nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the number of total varieties (8) and r is the number of donuts chosen (6), the calculation would be 8C6 = 28.\n\n(d) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, then there are 2^8 - 8 - 1 = 247 ways to choose the donuts. This is calculated by considering all possible combinations of 8 varieties (2^8), then subtracting the 8 ways where all donuts are of the same variety and the 1 way where no donuts are chosen.\n\n(e) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, the problem can be solved by finding the combinations of the remaining donuts. If we take 3 blueberry donuts, we are left with 3 donuts to be chosen from 8 varieties (including the blueberry). This gives us 8C3 = 56 ways. However, this includes the ways where all 3 remaining donuts are blueberry, which we have to subtract. So the final answer is 56 - 1 = 55 ways.\n\n(f) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, the problem can be solved by considering the cases separately where we have 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts.

So, there are 8 ways to do this.\n\n(c) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, you are asking for the number of ways to distribute 6 identical items (donuts) into 8 different categories (varieties).

We calculate the ways for each case and then add them together:\n\n- No blueberry: C(7 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(12, 6) = 924 ways\n- One blueberry: C(7 + 5 - 1, 5) = C(11, 5) = 462 ways\n- Two blueberries: C(7 + 4 - 1, 4) = C(10, 4) = 210 ways\n\nAdding these together, we get 924 + 462 + 210 = 1,596 ways."}
