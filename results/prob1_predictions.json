There are 8 such cases (one for each variety), so we have 1716 - 8 = 1708.\n\nSo, the answers in json format are:\n\n{1: 28, 6: 63, 3: 1716, 4: 1708}", "1#6#3#5#": "{\n\"1\": 28,\n\"6\": 3003,\n\"3\": 11440,\n\"5\": 1540\n}", "1#6#4#2#": "{1: 28, 2: 1, 4: 503, 6: 4753}", "1#6#4#3#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"6\": 792, \"4\": 3003, \"3\": 3003 }", "1#6#4#5#": "{1: 28, 6: 3003, 4: 3003, 5: 56}", "1#6#5#2#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"2\": 8, \"5\": 1260, \"6\": 3003 }", "1#6#5#3#": "I am an AI and I will calculate all the possible combinations for each case:\n\n(1) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, then we are simply choosing 6 donuts from 8 varieties. This is a combination problem (since order doesn't matter), and the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / [(n - k)! * k!], where \"n\" is the number of total options, \"k\" is the number of options chosen, and \"!\" denotes a factorial (the product of all positive integers up to that number). Plugging in the given numbers, we get C(8, 6) = 8! / [(8 - 6)! * 6!] = 28.\n\n(6) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have several situations to consider. We can have no blueberry donuts, one blueberry donut, or two blueberry donuts. For each of these cases, the rest of the donuts can be any variety. This leads to a sum of combinations:\nC(8, 6) + C(8, 5) * C(1, 1) + C(8, 4) * C(2, 2) = 28 + 56 + 70 = 154.\n\n(5) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we have three situations to consider. We can have three, four, five, or six blueberry donuts. For each of these cases, the rest of the donuts can be any variety. This leads to a sum of combinations:\nC(1, 1) * C(7, 3) + C(1, 1) * C(7, 2) + C(1, 1) * C(7, 1) + C(1, 1) * C(7, 0) = 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64.\n\n(3) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, then we can choose any donut from the 8 varieties for each of the 6 slots in the bag. This is a permutation problem with replacement (since we can choose the same variety multiple times), and the formula is n^k, where \"n\" is the number of total options and \"k\" is the number of options chosen.

So, we have C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716.\n\n(5) For the second scenario, since there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts, we can subtract 3 from the total number of donuts to choose, which gives us 3 donuts left to choose freely from the 8 varieties.

The total is C(7+3-1, 3) + C(7+2-1, 2) + C(7+1-1, 1) + C(7+0-1, 0) = 220 + 56 + 7 + 1 = 284.\n\n(6) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we consider four cases: 0, 1, and 2 blueberry-filled donuts. For each case, we calculate the number of ways to fill the rest of the bag from the remaining 7 varieties. The total is C(7+6-1, 6) + C(7+5-1, 5) + C(7+4-1, 4) = 792 + 792 + 330 = 1914.\n\n(1) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this means we are choosing 6 unique varieties from 8, which is simply C(8,6) = 28.\n\nSo, the final answers are:\n\n{4: 1708, 5: 284, 6: 1914, 1: 28}", "4#5#6#2#": "{\n\"4\": 109375,\n\"5\": 5880,\n\"6\": 324632,\n\"2\": 8\n}", "4#5#6#3#": "To answer these questions, we need to apply combinatorics, specifically the concept of combinations with repetitions. \n\n(4) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, the task is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to the equation x1 + x2 + ... + x8 = 6, where xi \u2265 1 for at least two i's, and xi \u2265 0 for the rest. There are (6+8-1 C 6) - 8 = 1287 - 8 = 1279 total combinations. But we subtract 8 because there are 8 ways to choose all 6 donuts of the same type. \n\n(5) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we fix 3 donuts as blueberry and have 3 more to choose out of 8 varieties. This is equivalent to finding solutions to the equation x1 + x2 + ... + x8 = 3, where xi \u2265 0. The number of solutions is (3+8-1 C 3) = 120.\n\n(6) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can divide this task into 3 subtasks - no blueberry, one blueberry, two blueberry - and sum up the results.

The total number of ways to choose k items from n is given by the combination formula: nCk = n! / [(n-k)!k!], where '!' denotes factorial. So, the total number of ways is 8C6 = 28. Thus, the answer to the first question is 28 - 8 = 20.\n\nFor the second question, we can choose 0, 1, or 2 blueberry-filled donuts and fill the rest with any variety. The number of ways to do this is the sum of the number of ways to choose k blueberry-filled donuts and 6-k other donuts for k from 0 to 2.

So, we just need to calculate the number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties.\n\nFor the fourth scenario, we must have at least two varieties.

This can be calculated as follows:\n- Three blueberry donuts: C(7,3) = 35 ways\n- Four blueberry donuts: C(7,2) = 21 ways\n- Five blueberry donuts: C(7,1) = 7 ways\n- Six blueberry donuts: C(7,0) = 1 way\nThe total is 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64 ways.\n\n(1) If there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, this is a simple combination problem: C(8,6) = 28 ways.\n\n(4) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is equivalent to subtracting the number of ways to choose all donuts of the same variety (8 ways, one for each variety) from the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties without restriction (which is C(8+6-1,6) = 1716 ways). So the answer is 1716 - 8 = 1708 ways.\n\nSo, the final answer in JSON format is: \n\n{6: 63, 5: 64, 1: 28, 4: 1708}", "6#5#2#1#": "{ \"6\": 15685, \"5\": 3850, \"2\": 8, \"1\": 28 }", "6#5#2#3#": "{\n\"6\": 11336,\n\"5\": 735,\n\"2\": 8,\n\"3\": 3003\n}", "6#5#2#4#": "{\n\"(6)\": 16603,\n\"(5)\": 816,\n\"(2)\": 8,\n\"(4)\": 24752\n}", "6#5#3#1#": "I'm sorry, but as an AI, I'm not capable of calculating complex combinatorics problems on the fly.

Here are the answers:\n\nFor sub-question (1) - if there are no two donuts in the bag of the same variety, we are basically asking for the number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties with no repetition. This is a combinations problem, and the formula for combinations is C(n, r) = n! / [(n-r)!r!], where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial. In this case, n = 8 (varieties of donuts) and r = 6 (number of donuts to choose), so the answer is C(8, 6) = 28.\n\nFor sub-question (4) - if there must be at least two varieties in the bag, this is equivalent to the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties minus the 8 ways in which all 6 donuts could be of the same variety. The total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties without restriction is 8^6 = 262144. Therefore, the answer is 262144 - 8 = 262136.\n\nFor sub-question (6) - if there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, this is equivalent to the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties minus the ways in which there are 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry-filled donuts. Calculating this accurately requires a more complex application of combinatorial principles, so without the exact method, I am unable to provide a numerical answer for this sub-question.\n\nFor sub-question (5) - if there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, this too requires a more complex application of combinatorial principles, so without the exact method, I am unable to provide a numerical answer for this sub-question.\n\nFor sub-question (3) - if there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, this is a simple combinations problem where repetition is allowed. The formula for combinations with repetition is C(n + r - 1, r) = (n + r - 1)! / [(n - 1)!r!]. In this case, n = 8 (varieties of donuts) and r = 6 (number of donuts to choose), so the answer is C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716.\n\nSo, the JSON format answer would be:\n\n{1: 28, 4: 262136, 6: null, 5: null, 3: 1716}", "1#5#2#3#4#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"2\": 8, \"3\": 3003, \"4\": 3000, \"5\": 406 }", "1#5#2#3#6#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"2\": 8, \"3\": 3003, \"5\": 406, \"6\": 2793 }", "1#5#2#4#3#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"5\": 56, \"2\": 8, \"4\": 4013, \"3\": 1679616 }", "1#5#2#4#6#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"5\": 251, \"2\": 8, \"4\": 16384, \"6\": 15625}", "1#5#2#6#3#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"5\": 252, \"2\": 8, \"6\": 792, \"3\": 3003 }", "1#5#2#6#4#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"5\": 56, \"2\": 8, \"6\": 792, \"4\": 3267 }", "1#5#3#2#4#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"2\": 8, \"3\": 3003, \"4\": 56, \"5\": 651 }", "1#5#3#2#6#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"2\": 8, \"3\": 3003, \"5\": 126, \"6\": 2871 }", "1#5#3#4#2#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"2\": 8, \"3\": 1679616, \"4\": 1679600, \"5\": 792 }", "1#5#3#4#6#": "{\n\"(1)\": 0,\n\"(5)\": 56,\n\"(3)\": 3003,\n\"(4)\": 3000,\n\"(6)\": 2668\n}", "1#5#3#6#2#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1679616, \"5\": 792, \"6\": 7920 }", "1#5#3#6#4#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"5\": 56, \"3\": 3003, \"6\": 2668, \"4\": 3003 }", "1#5#4#2#3#": "{\n\"1\": 28,\n\"2\": 8,\n\"3\": 32768,\n\"4\": 32640,\n\"5\": 792\n}", "1#5#4#2#6#": "This question involves combinatorics and some assumptions are needed to answer it correctly.

Here are the methods needed to solve each case:\n\n(1) This is a simple combinations problem, because order doesn't matter and we're not allowed to repeat varieties. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!, where n is the total number of varieties, r is the number of donuts we are choosing, and '!' denotes factorial. \n\n(6) For this problem, we would need to sum the combinations of choosing 0, 1, or 2 blueberry-filled donuts and the remaining donuts from the other 7 varieties.\n\n(5) This is similar to (6), but now we need at least 3 blueberry-filled donuts. We would sum the combinations of choosing 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts and the remaining from the other 7 varieties.\n\n(3) This is the simplest case, as we can choose any of the 8 varieties for each of the 6 donuts.

So the answer is C(8+6-1, 6) = 792.\n\n(1) The number of ways to choose a bag of 6 donuts from 8 varieties with no two donuts in the bag of the same variety is a combination problem. This can be calculated using the formula C(n, r) where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts.

Therefore, the number of ways is 1716 - 8 = 1708.\n\n(6) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we calculate this by summing the combinations of cases when there are 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts.

Here, n represents the number of varieties (8 in this case) and r represents the number of donuts we need to choose (6 in this case).\n\nLet's calculate these:\n\n(3) = (8+6-1)C(6) = 5005\n(2) = 8\n(6) = (8+6-1)C(6) - (8+5-1)C(5) - 2*(8+4-1)C(4) = 4253\n(4) = (8+6-1)C(6) - 8 = 4997\n(1) = 8C6 = 28\n\nSo the responses in the required format are:\n\n{3: 5005, 2: 8, 6: 4253, 4: 4997, 1: 28}", "3#2#6#4#5#": "{ \"3\": 792, \"2\": 8, \"6\": 792, \"4\": 792, \"5\": 56 }", "3#2#6#5#1#": "{3: 792, 2: 8, 6: 634, 5: 171, 1: 28}", "3#2#6#5#4#": "{ \"3\": 3003, \"2\": 8, \"6\": 2668, \"5\": 792, \"4\": 3000 }", "3#4#1#2#5#": "{ \"3\": 3003, \"4\": 2926, \"1\": 28, \"2\": 8, \"5\": 792 }", "3#4#1#2#6#": "{3: 3003, 4: 3003, 1: 28, 2: 8, 6: 2668}", "3#4#1#5#2#": "{ \"3\": 3003, \"4\": 2925, \"1\": 28, \"5\": 1716, \"2\": 8 }", "3#4#1#5#6#": "{\n\"3\": 3003,\n\"4\": 2970,\n\"1\": 28,\n\"5\": 56,\n\"6\": 2933\n}", "3#4#1#6#2#": "{\"(3)\": 3003, \"(4)\": 2997, \"(1)\": 28, \"(6)\": 2940, \"(2)\": 8}", "3#4#1#6#5#": "{ \"3\": 3003, \"4\": 2997, \"1\": 28, \"6\": 2668, \"5\": 735 }", "3#4#2#1#5#": "{ \"3\": 3003, \"4\": 2925, \"2\": 8, \"1\": 28, \"5\": 756 }", "3#4#2#1#6#": "{\n\"3\": 3003,\n\"4\": 2925,\n\"2\": 8,\n\"1\": 28,\n\"6\": 2380\n}", "3#4#2#5#1#": "{\n\"3\": 3003,\n\"4\": 2997,\n\"2\": 8,\n\"5\": 1716,\n\"1\": 28\n}", "3#4#2#5#6#": "{\n\"(3)\": 3003,\n\"(4)\": 2936,\n\"(2)\": 8,\n\"(5)\": 56,\n\"(6)\": 2871\n}", "3#4#2#6#1#": "{\n\"(3)\": 3003,\n\"(4)\": 2925,\n\"(2)\": 8,\n\"(6)\": 2013,\n\"(1)\": 28\n}", "3#4#2#6#5#": "I'm sorry, but I'm an AI language model and I don't have the capability to compute complex probability problems like these directly.

The formula for this is C(n+r-1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts. Therefore, the answer is C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716.\n\n(5) If there must be at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we can break this problem into three cases: exactly 3, 4, or 5 blueberry donuts. For each case, we use the same formula as above, but with different values for n and r. Then, we sum up the results for each case.\n\n- 3 blueberry donuts: C(8+3-1, 3) * C(7+3-1, 3) = 56 * 84 = 4704.\n- 4 blueberry donuts: C(8+2-1, 2) * C(7+2-1, 2) = 36 * 28 = 1008.\n- 5 blueberry donuts: C(8+1-1, 1) * C(7+1-1, 1) = 8 * 7 = 56.\n\nSo, the total number of combinations is 4704 + 1008 + 56 = 5768.\n\n(2) If all donuts in the bag are of the same variety, we simply have 8 choices (one for each variety).\n\n(4) If there must be at least two varieties in the bag, we subtract from the total number of combinations the number of combinations where all donuts are of the same variety. Therefore, the answer is 1716 (from question 3) - 8 (from question 2) = 1708.\n\n(6) If there can be no more than two blueberry-filled donuts in the bag, we sum up the cases for 0, 1, and 2 blueberry donuts, similar to what we did in question 5.\n\n- 0 blueberry donuts: C(7+6-1, 6) = 792.\n- 1 blueberry donut: C(8+5-1, 5) * C(7+1-1, 1) = 792 * 7 = 5544.\n- 2 blueberry donuts: C(8+4-1, 4) * C(7+2-1, 2) = 330 * 21 = 6930.\n\nSo, the total number of combinations is 792 + 5544 + 6930 = 13266.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question in JSON format is:\n\n{3: 1716, 5: 5768, 2: 8, 4: 1708, 6: 13266}.", "3#5#2#6#1#": "{ \"3\": 3003, \"5\": 792, \"2\": 8, \"6\": 2380, \"1\": 28 }", "3#5#2#6#4#": "{\n\"3\": 3003,\n\"5\": 588,\n\"2\": 8,\n\"6\": 2668,\n\"4\": 2936\n}", "3#5#4#1#2#": "{\n  \"3\": 3003,\n  \"5\": 651,\n  \"4\": 3003 - 8,\n  \"1\": 28,\n  \"2\": 8\n}", "3#5#4#1#6#": "{3: 3003, 5: 792, 4: 2936, 1: 28, 6: 2673}", "3#5#4#2#1#": "{\n\"3\": 3003,\n\"5\": 1716,\n\"4\": 2936,\n\"2\": 8,\n\"1\": 28\n}", "3#5#4#2#6#": "{\n\"3\": 792,\n\"5\": 56,\n\"4\": 792,\n\"2\": 8,\n\"6\": 721\n}", "3#5#4#6#1#": "To solve these problems, we use the principles of combinatorics, specifically combinations and permutations with repetition.

So, it's C(8+6-1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716.\n\n(5) In this case, we must choose at least 3 blueberry-filled donuts. We can break this down into three cases: choosing exactly 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts. The remaining donuts can be any variety. So, we calculate C(8+3-1, 3) + C(8+2-1, 2) + C(8+1-1, 1) + C(8+0-1, 0) = 220 + 36 + 8 + 1 = 265.\n\n(4) This is a more complex problem. The total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties with no restrictions is C(13, 6) = 1716. We subtract the number of ways to choose all 6 donuts of the same variety, which is 8. So, the answer is 1716 - 8 = 1708.\n\n(6) This is similar to problem 5. We consider the cases of choosing 0, 1, or 2 blueberry donuts, and any variety for the remaining donuts.

Since we can't have two donuts of the same variety, we choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties.

You'd have to calculate the total number of ways to choose 6 donuts from 8 varieties (as in (3)) and then subtract the number of ways to choose all 6 donuts from one variety (as in (2)).\n\n(5) and (6) These would require assumptions about how many blueberry-filled donuts there are out of the 8 varieties.\n\nOnce you have the necessary information, you could calculate the answers and put them in the required JSON format.", "1#4#6#5#3#2#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"2\": 8, \"3\": 1679616, \"4\": 1663740, \"5\": 1716, \"6\": 1647086 }", "1#5#2#3#4#6#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"2\": 8, \"3\": 3003, \"4\": 2992, \"5\": 406, \"6\": 2668 }", "1#5#2#3#6#4#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"2\": 8, \"3\": 3003, \"4\": 3002, \"5\": 1716, \"6\": 1617 }", "1#5#2#4#3#6#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"5\": 56, \"2\": 8, \"4\": 16257, \"3\": 3003, \"6\": 2668}", "1#5#2#4#6#3#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"2\": 8, \"3\": 1679616, \"4\": 1679610, \"5\": 792, \"6\": 1562260 }", "1#5#2#6#3#4#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"2\": 8, \"3\": 3003, \"4\": 2796, \"5\": 406, \"6\": 2745 }", "1#5#2#6#4#3#": "{1: 28, 2: 8, 3: 3003, 4: 3003, 5: 56, 6: 2668}", "1#5#3#2#4#6#": "{\n\"(1)\": 0,\n\"(2)\": 8,\n\"(3)\": 3003,\n\"(4)\": 29393,\n\"(5)\": 856,\n\"(6)\": 2786\n}", "1#5#3#2#6#4#": "{1: 28, 2: 8, 3: 3003, 4: 28, 5: 756, 6: 2668}", "1#5#3#4#2#6#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"2\": 8, \"3\": 3003, \"4\": 29393, \"5\": 1716, \"6\": 23751 }", "1#5#3#4#6#2#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"2\": 8, \"3\": 3003, \"4\": 29393, \"5\": 1716, \"6\": 2604 }", "1#5#3#6#2#4#": "{ \"1\": 28, \"2\": 8, \"3\": 3003, \"4\": 2667, \"5\": 651, \"6\": 1953 }", "1#5#3#6#4#2#": "To answer these questions, we need to use the principles of combinations and permutations in combinatorial mathematics.

This would be C(8+6-1, 6) + C(8+5-1, 5) + C(8+4-1, 4) = 1716 + 792 + 330 = 2838.\n\nTherefore, in JSON format, the answers are:\n\n{\"3\": 1716, \"5\": 120, \"1\": 20160, \"4\": 1708, \"2\": 8, \"6\": 2838}", "3#5#1#4#6#2#": "{\n\"3\": 3003,\n\"5\": 1716,\n\"1\": 28,\n\"4\": 3000,\n\"6\": 2668,\n\"2\": 8\n}", "3#5#1#6#2#4#": "{ \"3\": 3003, \"5\": 792, \"1\": 28, \"6\": 2907, \"2\": 8, \"4\": 2995 }", "3#5#1#6#4#2#": "{3: 3003, 5: 210, 1: 28, 6: 2835, 4: 3003, 2: 8}", "3#5#2#1#4#6#": "{\n\"3\": 3003,\n\"5\": 161,\n\"2\": 8,\n\"1\": 28,\n\"4\": 2936,\n\"6\": 2821\n}", "3#5#2#1#6#4#": "{\n  \"3\": 792,\n  \"5\": 406,\n  \"2\": 8,\n  \"1\": 28,\n  \"6\": 792,\n  \"4\": 792\n}", "3#5#2#4#1#6#": "{\n  \"3\": 3003,\n  \"5\": 462,\n  \"2\": 8,\n  \"4\": 2992,\n  \"1\": 28,\n  \"6\": 2548\n}", "3#5#2#4#6#1#": "{\n\"1\": 28,\n\"2\": 8,\n\"3\": 3003,\n\"4\": 2993,\n\"5\": 126,\n\"6\": 2877\n}", "3#5#2#6#1#4#": "{3: 3003, 5: 792, 2: 8, 6: 2380, 1: 28, 4: 3003}", "3#5#2#6#4#1#": "{3: 3003, 5: 792, 2: 8, 6: 2925, 4: 2936, 1: 28}", "3#5#4#1#2#6#": "To answer these questions, we need to use combinatorial mathematics - the study of counting, arrangement, and permutation. The Multinomial Theorem or Multinomial Coefficients can be used to solve these problems. \n\n(3) If there are no restrictions on the contents of the bag, we can consider this as a problem of distributing 6 identical items (donuts) into 8 different groups (varieties).

In this case, the formula for combinations with repetition is C(n + r - 1, r), where n is the number of varieties and r is the number of donuts to choose. So, we have C(8 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(13, 6) = 1716.\n\n(5) For the second question, we must have at least three blueberry-filled donuts in the bag. This means we can have 3, 4, 5, or 6 blueberry donuts. We need to calculate each of these possibilities and sum them. For example, if we have 3 blueberry donuts, we need to choose 3 more from the remaining 7 varieties. So, we have C(7 + 3 - 1, 3) = C(9, 3) = 84.
